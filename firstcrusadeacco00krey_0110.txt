thinking up new demands to be made from the Emperor and adding
additional demands to those already made, the Emperor very easily
frustrated the designs which were concealed by them. Approach-
ing them in various ways, he at length compelled them to yield to
the oath ot Godfrey, who had been summoned across the water
t'rom Pelecanzcm in order to be present at the taking of the solemn
oath.

&Vhen all were assembled for this purpose, Godfrey likewise pres-
ent, and the oath had already been taken, a certain one of the
counts, a noble, forsooth, mounted the Emperor's throne and seated
himself on it. The Emperor refrained from saying anything against
the man, for he had long been sufficiently acquainted with the un-
wonted arrogance of the Latins. Count Baldwin, however, ap-
proached and, grasping the man by the hand, shook him and, with
much cursing, said: “You are not permitted on solemn oath to do
anything like this here, especially after you have professed service
to the Emperor, for it is not customary for Roman Emperors to

as they were about to leave, he had the very arrogant and impudent
Latin summoned and asked him who, and whence he waS‚ and of
what race he was born.

He answered: “I am a pure Frank ot' noble birth. Moreover,
I know one (thing). In the section of the country where I was
born stands a temple, built long ago, in which any person who
wishes to engage in battle with someone, and does not hesitate to
give his name freely in professing this boldness, is wont to implore
the aid of the saint, delaying there until an adversary appears who
dares to join hands with him. In this meeting place I remained for
a long time, awaiting someone to contend with me; but there was
never anyone who dared.”

The Emperor, hearing these things, replied: “Wess, if in your
quest of an adversary you did not then find one, the time is now
at hand which will afford you more than enough opponents. How-
