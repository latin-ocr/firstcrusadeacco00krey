108 THE FIRST CRUS.-xDE

leons-'⁴ sussercd for Christ, has been made desolate by the Turks.
From here xve hurried on to the very large city of Nicaea, singing
praise to (iod (as we marched).

More than three hundred towers, my beloved, with walls of mar-
velous construction enclose Nicaea. We found the Turks within
it bold fighters; here we discovered >that the infinite army of God
had now for four weeks been engaged in a death—dealing struggle
with the people of Nicaea. Shortly before we came to the army,
Soliman, prince of the Turks, had suddenly rushed upon our men
with a large army prepared for battle, thinking that by a certain
charge he could break into the city to aid his people. This base
design, through the compassion of God, turned out otherwise than
he thought. For our men, getting themselves ready most quickly,
received the Turks with fierce spirits All the latter turned their
backs in flight immediately. Our men, following them very closely,
killed many of them and pursued them over a wide space of terri-
tory, wounding and killing them; and had not the difficult moun-
tains been unknown to our men, on *that same day they would have
driven the enemy to great and irremediable destruction. Of our
men, no one perished at that time, but afterwards, as our great
army together engaged in many most sharp encounters, killing many
of the Turks and their leaders with hurling engines and arrows,
some of our men were killed, though, truly‚ not many—no knight
of renown except Baldwin of Flanders, Count of Ghent. When our
worthy princes of God saw Nicaea so turreted, as we have said
above, they constructed with great labor very high wooden towers
provided with loop—holes and various engines. The Turks‚ upon
beholding this, were overcome with sear and surrendered the city
to the Emperor by envoys, on condition that he permit 'them to go
out of the city naked, under safe conduct, and that they be held
alive in captivity by the Emperor.

(Stephen.) When the Emperor heard this, he came near, al-
most up to us. However, he dared not enter his own city of Nicaea
at all, for fear that the infinite throng of inhabitants, who revered
him as their benevolent father, would smother him in their exulta-
tion. He established himself on a certain island of the sea near αἱ)
All our princes, except myselt' and the Count of St. Gilles, ran t
him to celebrate so great a victory with him, and he received them,
as was proper, with very great affection. And, because he heard
that I had remained near the city, lest, by chance, a most hostile
horde of Turks should overcome our army and the city, he was
