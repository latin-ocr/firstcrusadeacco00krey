THE FIRST CRUSADE 239

weight, he likewise composed his expression. They (lug, but without
avai13 the upturned earth could not return what had not been com-
mitted to it, and what it had not received. However, the man had
secreted about him an Arabic spear point, from the chance finding
of which he had contrived material for his deception. 'l'herefore,
seizing the hardened, worn, and aged point, which was in form and
size unlike those which we used, he was encouraged thereby to
believe that people would put faith in his new creations. Accord-
ingly, when the time for the deception came, he took a spade, jumped
into the pit and, turning to a corner, said, “Here we must (lig.
Here lies hidden what we seek. Here it will come forth.'’ Then,
multiplying blow on blow‚ often and more often, he pulled forth
from the dug up ground the spear which had been fraudulently
dropped by him. The darkness conspired in the deception; likewise‚
the throng of people with the darkness, and the narrowness of the
pit with the throng. But when the sound of metal striking upon
metal was heard, this same fabricator of lies held out the iron and
filled the excited ears of the simple with these words: “Lo, behold!
Heaven promised what the earth preserved3 the apostle revealed

triumph should be ascribed to the Lance, which was borne ahead in
battle, as if it were a trophy. And so, the treasury of Raymond
was enlarged‚ his spirit exalted, and his army became insolent.
Some of the princes whom he had joined to himself, partly by flat-
tery and partly by deference, sided with him.

But Bohemund, since he was no fool, scrutinized the matter in
detail. For who was that dreamer? In what vagaries had he
involved the people? What place had he pointed out to the diggers?
In the fact that he himself had leaped into it, had (lug and found it,
Bohemund immediately detected a trick. He decided that the find—
ing was invalid and proved the inventor false by keen conjectures:
“Beautifully,'' said he, “was it contrived that St. Andrew should
appear to a man who, I hear, frequents taverns, roams the streets‚
is a friend to vanities and ingrained with folly! The holy apostle
chose a fine person to whom to disclose the secret of heaven! For
to whom would that trick not be evident? If a Christian had hidden
it, why did he pass over the nearest altar for a hiding place, or if a
