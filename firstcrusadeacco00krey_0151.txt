(Anselm.) However, moving camp from Nicaea on the fourth
day before the Kalends of July‚ we kept to the march for three
days. On the fourth day, the Turks, with forces gathered from all
sides, again attacked a smaller part of our army; moreover, they
killed many of our men and drove all the rest within the camp
itself. The men in command of this part of the army were Bohe--
mundffiCount of the Romans,¹1 Count Stephen, and the Count of
,Flanders To these in such fearful straits there suddenly appeared
the standards of the larger army; in the front rode Hugh the Great‚
and the Duke of Lorraine, but the Count of St. Gilles‚ as well as
the venerable Bishop of Puy, were following. For they had heard
of the battle and were hastening to their aid. Moreover‚ the Turks
are estimated as 260900, upon whom our men advanced, killing
many and forcing the rest to flight. On this day I returned from
the Emperor, to whom the princes had sent me for our common
interest. ’ From this day our princes, remaining together in one
army, did not separate from each other. And while we were thus
crossing the regions of Romania and Armenia we found no obstacle,
except that after we had passed Iconium our advance guard en-
countered a few Turks. These were put to flight, and on the twelfth
day before the Kalends of November we laid siege to Antioch. ’
Then we took by force the neighboring cities of Tarsus and Lao-
dicaea. One day, however, before we had surrounded the city in
siege, we put to ssight at the Iron Bridge some Turks who had gone
out to devastate the region, and we snatched from them many
Christians; moreover, we led back horses and camels (laden) with
very great plunder. But after we had surrounded the city in siege,
the Turks of the nearest castle were daily killing those of the
army going in and out. The princes of our army came upon them
in hiding and killed four hundred of them and drove others head—
long into a certain river. Some, however, they brought along with
them.

Know that we are besieging Antioch with all diligence to take it
very shortly, as we think. We are abundantly supplied with grain,
wine, oil, and all goods beyond belief. However, I ask you and
all to whom this letter shall have come to pray God for us and for
our dead. The following are those who have perished in arms: At
Nicaea, Baldwin of Ghent‚ Baldwin Chalderuns, who was the first
to do battle with the Turks. On the Kalends of July in battle,
Robert of Paris, Lisiard of Flanders, Hilduin of Mazingarbe‚ An-
sellus of Caium, Manasses of Clermont. The following are those
