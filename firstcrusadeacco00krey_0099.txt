THE FIRST CRUSADE 81

peror because of some fiattering promise, but to sit outside the
walls and listen carefully to all which the Emperor should propose
to him. Thereupon, the Duke, so warned by the strangers, and
taught by the deception of the Greeks, did not go to the Emperor.

For this reason, the Emperor, moved by a violent indignation to- Ἴ
wards the Duke and all his army, refused them the privilege of =

buying and selling. But when Baldwin, brother of the Duke,
learned of the wrath of the Emperor and saw the need of the
people and their very great lack of necessaries‚ he pleaded with the
Duke and the leaders to plunder again the region and lands of the
Greeks, and to collect spoils and food, until the Emperor, com-
pelled by this damage, should again grant the privilege of buying
and selling. Therefore, when the Emperor saw devastation and
misfortune befalling the lands of his kingdom, he once more gave
to all the privilege of buying and selling.

It was the time of the Nativity of the Lord. At that festal time,
and in those days of peace and joy, it seemed to all praiseworthy,

asking, for the sake of the Emperor and his entreaties‚ that he would
move his camp, and with his army lodge in the houses situated 011

and worn from wintry cold and snow‚ which was threatening in
that rainy season. Finally, the Duke and all· the other leaders
yielded to the will of the Emperor, and, after moving their tents‚
they, with all the Christian army, lodged in the castles and turreted
buildings which were along the shore for a distance of thirty miles
From that day on successively they found and bought every abun-
dance of food and necessities by order of the Emperor.

Shortly after, an embassy of the Emperor again appeared before
the Duke, urging him to go and learn what the Emperor had to say.
This the Duke absolutely refused to do, having been warned by the
strangers of the craftiness of the Emperor. But he sent to him
as messengers the distinguished men Conon, Count of Montaigu‚
Baldwin of Burg‚ and Godfrey of Ascha, who were to make ex-
cuses for him, speaking in this manner: “Duke Godfrey to the
Emperor; trust and obedience. Willingly and eagerly would I
come before you to look upon the wealth and glory of your house-
