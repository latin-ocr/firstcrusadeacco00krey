¹24 THE FIRST CRUSADE

found Turks and Saracena, fought with them, killed many of them,
and pursued the rest closely. The Armenian inhabitants of the
land, seeing that he had bravely overcome the pagans, straightway
surrendered to him. He immediately took the city of Rusa,⁹ and
very many fortified places. ’

However‚ we who had remained, going thence, entered a diaboli-
cal mountain, which was so high and steep that none of us dared
to step before another through the pass which was open in the
mountain. There horses fell headlong, and one pack animal pushed
over another. The knights stood there, sad; they beat themselves
with their hands for their great grief and sadness‚ uncertain what
they should do about themselves and their arms, selling their shields
and their best breast-plates, together with their helmets‚ for only
three or five denarii, or whatever they could get. Those who could

struggle. Our men, therefore, having defeated them by the grace
of God, captured great spoils—homes, camels, mules, asses laden
with grain and wine. At length our men went and encamped on
the bank of the river. Forthwith, the wise man, Bohemund, went
with four thousand knights to watch before the gate of the city,
(to see) whether, perchance, anyone was leaving or entering the
city secretly by night.

we came peacefully and quickly across Romania up to Antioch.
But the Count kept his army a short distance behind because of his
illness. A certain incident brought about by divine clemency should
not be passed in silence, even though we knew that it would be
