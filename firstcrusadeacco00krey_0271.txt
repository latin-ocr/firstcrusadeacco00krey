⁴ THE FIRST CRUSADE Ἴ 24η

2. The Sieye. (June 7—July 15, 1099.)

(Gesta.) Rejoicing and exulting, we reached the city of Jeru-

salem on Tuesday, on the third clay of the week, the eighth day
before the Ides of June, and began to besiege the city in a marvelous
manner.⁷ Robert the Norman besieged it from the north side, near
the church of St. Stephen‚ which was built on the very spot where
that first martyr won eternal happiness by being stoned in Christ’s
name. Next to the Norman Count was Robert, Count of Flanders‚
while Duke Godfrey and Tancred besieged the city from the west.
The Count of St. Gilles located himself on the south, on Mount
Zion, near the church of St. Mary, the mother of the Lord, where
Christ once supped with His disciples.

On the third day some of our men, namely Raymond Piletus and
Raymond of Turenne, went out on a foraging expedition. They
encountered a force of two hundred Arabs, and the soldiers of
Christ fought these unbelievers. With the Lord's help, they fought
so valiantly that they killed many of the enemy and captured thirty
horses. On the second day of the following week‚ we made an
attack on the city, and so bravely did we fight that, if scaling ladders
had been ready for our use, the city most certainly would have
fallen into our hands. As it was, we pulled down the outer wall and
placed one ladder against the main wall, upon which some of our

against the Saracen defenders of the city. Many of our men were
killed in this attack‚ but more of the enemy.

For a period of ten days during the siege we were not able to
buy bread at any price, until a messenger came announcing the ar-
rival of our ships. We also suffered greatly for thirst. In sear and
terror we were forced to water our horses and other animals at a
distance of six miles from camp. The Pool οἱ Siloam, at the foot
of Mount Zion, sustained us, but, nevertheless, water was sold
among us very dearly.

„When the messenger arrived from our ships, the leaders took
counsel and decided that armed men should be sent to guard the
ships and sailors at the port of Joppa.* So one hundred men from
the army οἱ Raymond, Count of St. Gilles, under Raymond Piletus,
Achard of Montemerle, and William of Sabran,⁸ left camp in the
early dawn and started confidently toward Joppa. Thirty of these
knights separated themselves from the rest of the band and met
seven hundred Arabs, Turks, and Saracens from the army of the
Emir. The soldiers of Christ boldly attacked the enemy, whose
force was so superior to ours that they soon surrounded us. Achard
and some of the poor footmen were killed. While this band was
