28 THE FIRST CRUSADE

burners of houses and their accomplices be excommunicated from
the church and accursed. Therefore, we must consider especially,
as Gregory says, how great will be his punishment who steals from
another, if he incuss the damnation of hell who does not distribute
alms from his own possessions. For so it happened to the rich
man in the GospeL who was punished not for stealing anything

“By these evils, therefore, as Ι have said, dearest brethren, you
have seen the world disordered for a long time, and to such a de-
