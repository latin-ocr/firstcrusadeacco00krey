THE FIRST CRUSADE 1 17

At the second hour of the day, behold, their advance guards ap-
proached our scouts. When we had heard this, we pitched our
tents near a certain marsh and took off our pack saddles, so that
we would be better able to fight.

When this was done, the Emir and chief of the Turks, Soliman,
who had held in his possession the city of Nicaea and Romania,
gathered together about him the Turks and pagan Persians who,
after a J'ourney of thirty days at his command, had come to his aid.
There were present with him many chiefs and leaders such as
Admircaradiqzem, Miriathosf and many others. Altogether they
numbered 360,ooo fighters, all on horses and armed with bows‚ as
was their custom. We, on the other hand, had both foot-soldiers
and knights. But at that time Duke Godfrey and Count Raymond
and Hugh the Great had been two days absent from us. For some
unknown reason they had taken a branch road and withdrawn
themselves from us with a large number of our men. Therefore
an irreparable loss resulted, as much from the number of our
soldiers who were killed as from our failure to kill or capture the
Turks. And because those absent leaders received our messengers

rushed violently up to our tents and, entering them, snatched our
possessions and killed our people. Then, by the disposition of
God, the advance guard of Hugh the Great and Count Raymond
and Duke Godfrey came from the rear upon this unhappy scene.
When we had been driven up to our tents, those of the enemy who
were there fled out, thinking that we had returned to attack them.
But what they took for bravery and courage they should have
thought great fear.

What further shall Ι say? We were all huddled together, indeed,
like sheep shut in a pen, trembling and fright'ened, surrounded on
all sides by enemies‚ so that we were unable to advance in any
direction. It was clear to us that this besell us as a punishment
for our sins. For whomsoever luxury deffles, those, indeed, avarice‚
or some other vice, corrupts. The air was lashed with a great out-
cry from men, women, and children, as well as from the pagans,
who rushed upon us. Now there was no hope of life left to us.
We then confessed that we were debtors and sinners and humbly
begged mercy from God. There were present the Bishop of Puy,
our patron, and four other prelates. Many priests, vested in white,
