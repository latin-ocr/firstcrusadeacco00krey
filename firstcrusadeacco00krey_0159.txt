THE FIRST CRUSADE 137

enduresl Why did you so vilely fiee? &Vas it, perchance, for the
reason that you wished to betray these knights and the host of
Christ, as you betrayed others in Hispania?” He was entirely
silent and no speech proceeded from his mouth. Almost all those
of Frankish race gathered together and humbly asked Lord Bohe-
mund not to let anything worse befall him. He nodded, with calm
countenance, and said, “To this I willingly consent for love of you,
if he will swear to me with his whole heart and mind that he will
never withdraw from the march to Jerusalem, whether for good
or evil; and it Tancred will agree not to let anything untoward bc-
fall him, either through him or his men.” XVhen William had
heard these words, he willingly agreed, and Bohemund forthwith
dismissed him. Later, indeed, Carpenter, caught in the greatest
villainy, slipped away by stealth without long delay. This poverty
and wretchedness God meted out to us because of our sins. Thus
in the whole army no one could find a thousand knights who had
horses of the best kind.

Meanwhile the hostile Tetiyns, upon hearing that the army of
the Turks had come upon us, said that he was afraid, thinking that
we would all perish and fall into the hands of the enemy. Fabri-

said: “Seignors and most illustrious men, you see that we are here
in the greatest need, and aid is coming to us from no side. So
permit me now to return to my country of Romania, and I will,
for certain, cause many ships to come hither by sea, laden with
grain, wine, barley, meat, butter, and cheese‚ and all the goods
which you,need. I shall also cause horses to be brought for sale,
and a market to be brought hither in the sealty of the Emperor.
So I will swear all this loyally to you and attend to it. Also‚ my
servants and my tent are still in camp, from which you may believe
firmly that I will return as quickly as possible.'’ And so he con-
cluded his speech. That foe went and left all his possessions in the
camp, and he remains, and will remain, in perjury.

a Therefore in this way the greatest need came upon us, because
the Turks pressed us on all sides, so that none of us dared now to
go out of the tents, for they constrained us on one side, and ex·-
cruciating hunger on the other3 but of succour and help we had
none. The lesser folk, and the very poor fled to Cyprus, Romania,
and into the mountains. Through fear of the most evil Turks we
dared not go to the sea, and the way was never made open to us.

Accordingly, when Lord Bohemund heard that an innumerable
host of Turks was coming against us, he went cautiously to th<-
others, saying: “Seignors, most illustrious knights, what are we
