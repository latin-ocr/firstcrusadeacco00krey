THE FIRST CRUSADE 99

of St. Gilles approached Constantinople. The Count remained there
with his own band. Therefore the illustrious man, Bohemund,
stayed behind with the Emperor, in order to plan with him how
they might provide a market for the people who were beyond the
city of Nicaea.

(Anna.) One of them especially, the Count of St. Gilles, he par—
ticularly favored because he saw in him superior prudence, tested
sincerity, candor of bearing, and, finally, such great zeal for truth
that he never placed anything before it. He was as far superior to
all the other Latins in all virtues as the sun is above th⁶e other stars.
For this reason, therefore, the Emperor kept him near him for the
time being.

VV'hen at the wish of the Emperor all had crossed over the Pro-
pontis and had arrived at Danzalium, Alexius‚ thus relieved from
care and trouble, had the Count of St. Gilles summoned and in talks
showed him very distinctly what he thought might happen to the
Latins on the way. At the same time. he disclosed to him what
suspicions he was cherishing about the intentions and plans of the
Gauls. He often sposke freely about them with the Count of St.
Gilles, opening the doors of his heart to him, as it were, and mal<-
ing everything clearly known to him. He sometimes warned him,
also, to keep close watch against the malice of Bohemund, so as to
check him immediately if he should try to break his agreement, and
to strive in every way to destroy his schemes. The Count of St.
Gilles replied: “Since Bohemund has inherited perjury and deceit,
as it were, it would be very surprising if he should be faithful to
those promises which he has made under oath. However, Ι will
try to carry out what you command, in so far as I can.’⁷ Then at
the wish of the Emperor he departed, joining himself to the forces
of the united Gauls. . . .

(Pulcher.) We could not enter that city, for the Emperor, fear*
ing that possibly we would do some damage to him, did not wish
to let us. So it was necessary that we buy our daily supplies out-
side the walls. These, by the order of the Emperor, the citizens
brought to us. We were not allowed to enter the city many at a
time. ¹Only five or six per hour were permitted; thus, while some
were leaving, others were then entering to pray in the churches.

Oh, what a great and beautiful city is Constantinople! How many
churc‘hes and palaces it contains, fashioned with wonderful skill!
How many wonderful things may be seen even in the streets or
