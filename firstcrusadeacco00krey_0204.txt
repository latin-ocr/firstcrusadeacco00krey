182 THE FIRST CRUSADE

'Aquas in cruce levatus immolandus stipite, let them finish the hymn
on bended knees.”

XVhen, however, the Bishop of Orange and I, after this, asked
Peter Bartholomew if he knew letters, he rephed, ‘⁴1 do not‚’y think-
ing that if he were to say “I do,’' we would not believe him. He
did know a littleg but at that hour he was so ignorant that he neither
knew letters nor had any remembrance of the things he had learned
from letters, except the Paternoster‚ Credo in Deum, Mei-ynificat,
Glory in Excelsis Deo, and Benedictus Dominus Deus Israel. He
had lost the others as if he had never heard them, and though he
was able afterwards to recover a few, it was with the greatest effort.

4. Defecit of Kerboylza. (June 28, 1098)

(Gesta). From that hour we took counsel of battle among our-
selves. Fortwith, all our leaders decided upon the plan of sending
a messenger to the Turks, enemies of Christ, to ask them with
assured address: “Wherefore have you most haughtily entered
the land of the Christians, and why have you encamped, and why
do you kill and assail servants of Christ ?'' When their speech was
already ended, they found certain men, Peter the Hermit and Herl-
win, and they told them as follows: “Go to the accursed army of
the Turks and carefully tell them all this, asking them why they
have boldly and haughtily entered the land of the Christians and
our own ?'’

At these words, the messengers left and went to the profane assem-
blage, saying everything to Curbara and the others as follows:
“Our leaders and nobles wonder wherefore you have rashly and
most haughtily entered their land, the land of the Christians? We

think, forsooth, and believe that you have thus come hither because ’

you wish to become Christians fully; or have you come hither for
the purpose of harassing the Christians in every way? All our.
leaders together ask you, therefore, quickly to leave the land of
God and the Christians, which the blessed apostle, Peter, by his
preaching converted long ago to the worship of Christ. But they
grant, in addition, that you may take away all your belongings, horses,
mules, asses, camels, sheep, and cattle; all other belongings they
permit you to carry with you, wherever you may wish.''

Then Curbara, chief of the army ‚of the Sultan of Persia, with
all the others full of haughtiness‚ answered in fierce language: “Your
God and your Christianity we neither seek nor desire, and we spurn
you and them absolutely. We have now come even hither because
we marvelled greatly why the princes and nobles whom you mention
call this land theirs, the land we took from an effeminate people.
