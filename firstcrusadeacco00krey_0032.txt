16 THE FIRST CRUSADE

compelled the Church to keep a calendar, while the custom of
regulating the ordinary affairs of life with reference to the chief
festival days of the Church had long since become an established
habit of Christian Europe. The old Roman Calendar‚ too, continued
to exert some influence despite the efforts of the Church tc· supplant
it with a Christian scheme. As a result, the days of the month are
reckoned both by Kalends, Nones, and Ides, and by the numerica]
count of days from the incoming or outgoing month. Days of the
week bear the old Roman names and the canonical enumeration
from the Lord's Day, as well. Time of day is expressed usually by
means of the canonical hours, Matins‚ Prime, Terce, Sext, None,
Vespers‚ and Compline, though such expressions as cock-crow,
earliest dawn, and sunrise also occur. Time of day, and day of
year are sometimes noted by the psalms and prayers customary at
those times. Local variations in reckoning the beginning of the year
and seasons, or in expressing dates by festivals of loyal saints, a
practice quite common in the VVest, appear rather infrequently in
these accounts.⁷

3. Numbers.

The figures used by mediaeval writers in stating numbers of
people have baffled modern investigators. In order to discover the
actual numbers involved, it has become almost a rule to divide the
figures of the chroniclers by ten. Perhaps it would be fairer to
regard almost all numbers over one thousand as figures of speech,
intended only to convey the impression of a very large number.
Roman numerals alone were in use, and neither the average writer
nor the average reader of the period had very much training in
arithmetic. It was certainly a difficult task to describe, if not a
more difficult task to decipher, a very uneven number of six' figures
in Roman numerals. Quite aside from the mere mechanical diffi-
culty of the rask, few, if any persons, had had experience in dealing
with large numbers. Neither commercial, ecclesiastical‚ nor military
establishments dealt> accurately in very large amounts or numbers
at this time. As a result, when these chroniclers found themselves
in the midst of the vast host which composed the crusading army
they were struck with amazement. Nothing in their previous ex-
perience afforded them a satisfactory basis for estimating the size of
the army. The numbers implied in their frequent resort to the
term “countless” and “innu1nerable,” or “as the sands of the sea,”
and “as the leaves of autumn‚'' are probably almost as accurate as
the numerals which they employ. The actual number of persons
who took part in the First Crusade cannot be fixed with any cer-
