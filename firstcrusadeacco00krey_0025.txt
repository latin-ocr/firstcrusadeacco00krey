THE FIRST CRUSADE 9

probable impression conveyed by the returning Crusaders both as
to the bravery of the Provencal host and the validity of the Holy
Lance, especially the latter. He himself had been among the first
to accept the visions ot' Peter Bartholomew‚ had participated in the
digging for the Lance, and even the apparently adverse judgment
of the Ordeal was not sufficient to shake his saith in it. A large
part of his work, therefore, is a brief in defense of the Lance, in
support of which he adduces vision after vision and numerous wit-
nesses. The rest of his book is devoted to the part played by Count
Raymond, Bishop Adhemar, and the Provencal host in the Crusade.
All this is true, but it cannot be said in justice that he is totally
blind to the faults of either leader or people. To the historian the
book is second in importance only to the Gesta, for it was the work
of an eye-witness, written possibly no earlier than 1102, though
undoubtedly on the basis of notes taken during the journey. It
must be regarded as an independent account, even though, as Hagen-
meyer conjectures, its author may have used details from the
Gesta to correct his own account. For what may be termed the
sociological aspects of the Crusade. Rayrnond’s history is the most
valuable of all the accounts. six MS copies of. the work are
extant.

The third account of the Crusade as a whole was written by {Mc

Fulcher of ChaLtssS, whose career can be traced more fully than
that of any other eye-witness chronicler of the Crusade. Born
probably at Chartres in 1059, he was trained for the service of the
Church‚ and when the Council of Clermont was held in 1095 he
was a priest either at Chartres or at Orleans. The enthusiasm
which swept over the land claimed him, as it did so many of his
countrymen‚ so that when the army of Stephen of Blois moved from

Chartres, late in 1096, Fulcher was one of. the band. He was with„

Stephen’s army until October, 1097, when he became the chaplain
of Baldwin‚ Godfrey’s brother. From this time until Baldwin’s
death in 1118 he remained in that capacity, closely associated with
the energetic leader. As a result, he was present neither at the
siege of Antioch nor at that of Jerusalem, being then at Edessa,
which place he did not leave until late in 1099, when he made a

pilgrimage to Jerusalem with Baldwin and Bohemund. When Bald- -

win was summoned to take the 161115 of government upon the death
of Godfrey‚ Fulcher accompanied him to Jerusalem, where he re-
mained until the time of his own death in 1127 or 1128.
