THE FIRST CRUSADE 119

only let us come in.’' They destroyed the churches, homes, and
everything else, upon entering, and carried off with them the homes,
asses, mules, gold, and silver, and whatever they could find. In
addition, also, they carried off the children of Christians with them
and burned and devastated everything that was convenient or use-
ful, fleeing, greatly frightened, before our faces. Accordingly, we
were following them through deserts, and dry and uninhabitable
land, from which we scarcely escaped and carne out alive. Hunge1
and thirst pinched us on all sides, and there was absolutely nothing
for us to eat, unless, by chance, tearing and grinding grain with our
hands, we continued to exist on such food as wretchedly as pos-
sible. , There most of our cavalry ceased to exist, because (there-
after) many of these became foot-soldiers. For want of horses,
our men used oxen in place of cavalry horses, and because of the
very great need, goats, sheep, and dogs served as beasts of burden.

Meanwhile we began to enter the best land, filled with bodily
nourishment‚ delicacies, and goods of all kinds, and then we ap-

until they came to Heraclea, in which town there was a very large
gathering of Turks, waiting and plotting how they could harm and
put to grief the knights of Christ. The knights of Almighty God

overcome on that day, and they fled as swiftly as an arrow flies
when discharged with a mighty pull of string and bow. Our men,
accordingly, entered the vcity immediately and remained there for
four days.

(Fulcher.) Then, indeed, we continued our journey quietly, one
day suffering such extreme thirst that many men and women died
from its torments. Whole troops of Turks, fleeing before us, sought
refuge by scattering throughout Romania. Then we came to that
Antioch which they called the lesser, in the province of Pisidia.
and thence to Iconium. In these regions we very often were in
need of bread and other foods. For we found Romania, a land
which is good and very rich in all products, thoroughly devastated
and ravished by the Turks. Still, you would often see this multi-
tude of people well refreshed by whatever little vegetation we found
at intervals on this journey throughout barren regions. This hap-
pened by the aid of God, who from five loaves and two fishes fed
the five thousand. Wherefore, glad and rejoicing, we declared that
