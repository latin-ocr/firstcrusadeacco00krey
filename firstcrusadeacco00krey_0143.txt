4. lee march tlzrouyh Armenia. (The third week in October,
1097)

(Gesta.) The greater army, namely, Raymond, Count of St.
Gilles, the most learned Bohemund‚ Duke Godfrey, and the other
princeS, entered 1116131111 01 Armenia, thirsting and raging after
the blood of the Turks. At length, they came to a certain fortified
place which was so strong that they could do nothing to it. There
was there, however, a certain man named Simeon, who had been
born in that region, and who sought this land that he might defend
it against the hostile Turks. To him they willingly gave the land,
and he remained there with his people. Then, going from this
place, we came happily to Caesarea of Cappadocia. Going out of
Cappadocia, however, we came to a certain very beautiful and ex-
ceedingly fruitful city, which the Turks had besieg'ed for three
>weeks before our arrival, but had not conquered. Immediately upon
our arrival there, it straightway surrendered into our hands with
great pleasure. A certain knight whose name was Peter of the
Alps begged this from all the seignors to defend it in fealty to God,
the Holy Sepulchre, the seignors‚ and the Emperor. They granted
it to him freely, with great affection. On the following night 130116-
mund heard that the Turks who had been engaged in the siege of
the city were ahead of us in great numbers. Straightway he made
himself ready 10 3113611 1116111 011 311 511165 with his knights alone,
but he could not find them. Then we came to a certain city, coxon
by name, in which there was the greatest abundance of all goods
which we needed. Thereupon, the Christian inhabitants of that city
surrendered immediately, and we remained there three days very
well provided for, and our men were greatly refreshed.

When Raymond, Count of St. Gilles, heard that the Turks who
were in custody at Antioch had withdrawn, he concluded on his
'own counsel that he would send thither some of his knights to guard
the place diligently„ Then he chose those whom he wished to ap-
point, namely Peter, Viscount of Castillon, William of Montpellier,
Peter of Roasa, Peter Raymond of Hautpoul, with five hundred
knights. They came, accordingly, into a valley near Antioch to a
certainjortified place 01 1116 Publicani, and there they heard that
the Turks were in the city and ready to defend it vigorously. Peter
of Roasa there separated from the others and with the approach 01
night crossed near Antioch and entered the valley of Rugia. He
