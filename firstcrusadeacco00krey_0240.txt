218 THE FIRST CRUSADE

we have scarcely one thousand, and of two hundred thousand foot-
soldiers and more, there are not five thousand now in our army!
Shall we wait until all are destroyed? Why will they come from
our land when they hear that Antioch and Gibellum and the other
611165 01 1116 Saracens have been captured? But let us go to Jeru-
salem for which we came, and, verily, God will give it to us. And
then through fear alone of those who will come from our land and
other lands, these 611165, Gibellum, Tripoli, Tyre‚ and Aere, which
are on our march, will be abandoned by the inhabitants.’'

While we were thus proceeding forward, some Turks and Arabs
were following the army, killing and despoiling the poor, who,
because of their long illness, remained behind 1116 army. And when
they had done this once and again, the Count reinained in hiding
on the next day until all the army had passed. The enemy, in hope
of plunder 31111 without fear, followed our army in their 1151131 111311-
ner. But when they had already pased the ambush, our knights,
coming forth from their hiding place with the Count, attacked the
column of the enemy, routed them, and threw them into confusion.
Then they killed them and led their very fine 1101565 10 1116 army
with great exultation. After this, no enemy followed our army, be-
cause the Count with an armed multitude of knights went behind
our people. Moreover‚ other armed knights with the Count 01
N ormandy, Tancred, and the Bishop of Albara went ahead in great
numbers, so that the enemy might not unexpectedly disturb us from
either rear or front. For the Count, since he had few knights with
him when he set forth from Marta, asked the Bishop, after he had
placed a guard at Barsa, to come with him. The Bishop, hearing
of 3 66113111 knight 01 1115, William, son of Peter 01 Cumiliacmn,
by name, 1611 him there with seven knights and thirty foot-soldiers.
He was a man faithful and devoted to God and increased the prop-
erty of the Bishop by the help of God 1611-10111 111 3 short time. And
he soon had seventy men, instead of thirty, and sixty knights and
more.

It was decided at this time about our journey that we should
leave the road which led by Damascus and turn to the sea-coast,
because if our ships which we had left at Antioch should come
toward us, we would have trade with the people of the Isle of
Cyprus and the other islands. And when we started upon the route
agreed upon, the inhabitants of the land abandoned cities‚ fortified
places, and villages full of all goods. Thus, after encircling great
mountains, we carne into a certain very rich valley, where some
peasants‚ arrogant because of their numbers and the strength 01
111611 10111655, were willing neither to send to us for peace nor to
