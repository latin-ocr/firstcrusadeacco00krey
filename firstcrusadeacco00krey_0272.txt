danger from the Arabs, Turks‚ and 531366115, 31111 may all be dead
by this time. Hasten to 1116111 31111 3111 1116111.” Α5 50011 35 they
heard this, our men hastened to the scene 01 battle. When the
pagans saw the rest 01 0111 knights approaching, they formed 1116111-
561ν65 11110 two lines. Our men rushed upon the unbelievers, shout-
ing the name 01 Christ, each determined to bring down his man.
The enemy soon realized that they would not be able to withstand
the bravery 01 1116 Franks, so they turned their backs and fied in
terror. Our men, pursuing them 3 distance 01 10111 1111165, killed
many 01 1116111, but kept one alive to give them 111101111311011. One
