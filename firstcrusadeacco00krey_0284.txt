260 THE FIRST CRUSADE

strove to resist our efforts for the sake of the laws of Mohammed.
It is hard to believe how great were the efforts made on both sides
during the night.

When the morning came, our men eagerly rushed to the walls
and dragged the machines forward, but the Saracens had constructed
so many machines that for each one of ours they now had nine
or ten. Thus they greatly interfered with our efforts. This was
the ninth day, on which the priest had said that we would capture
the city. But why do Ι delay so long? Our machines were now
shaken apart by the blows of many stones‚ and our men lagged
because they were very weary. However, there remained the mercy
of the Lord which is never overcome nor conquered, but is always
a source of support in times of adversity. One incident must not be
omitted. Two women tried to bewitch one of the hurling machines,
but a stone struck and crushed them, as well as three slaves, so that
their lives were extinguished and the evil incantations averted.

By noon our men were greatly discouraged. They were weary
and at the end of their resources. There were still many of the
enemy opposing each one of our men: the walls were very high
and strong, and the great resources and skill that the enemy ex-
hibited in repairing their defenses seemed too great for us to over-
come. But, while we hesitated, irresolute, and the enemy exulted
in our discomfsture, the healing mercy of God inspired us and
turned our sorrow into joy, for the Lord did not forsake u's. While
a council was being held to decide whether or not our machines
should be withdrawn, for some were burned and the rest badly
shaken to pieces, a knight on the Mount of Olives began to wave
his shield to those who were with the Count and others, signalling
thern to advance. Who this knight was we have been unable to
find out. At this signal our men began to take heart, and some ”
began to batter down the wall, while others began to ascend by
means of scaling ladders and ropes. Our archers shot burning fire-
brands, and in this way checked the attack that the Saracens were
making upon the wooden towers of the Duke and the two Counts.
These firebmnds, moreover, were wrapped in cotton. This shower
of fire drove the defenders from the walls. Then the Count quickly
released the long drawbridge which had protected the side of the
wooden tower next to the wall, and it swung down from the top,
being fastened to the middle of the tower, making a bridge over
which the men began to enter Jerusalem bravely and fearlessly.
Among those who entered first were Tancred and the Duke of
Lorraine, and the amount of blood that they shed on that day is in-
credible. All ascended after thern, and the Saracens now began

to suffer.
