THE FIRST CRUSADE 247

Forsooth, these ships passed daily over the sea, and for this reason
the ships of the Greeks were safe, since the Saracens feared to
encounter them. But when the Angles saw the army setting forth
for Jerusalem, and that the strength of their own ships was im-
paired by the long wait (for though they had thirty ships in the
beginning, they now had scarcely nine or ten), some abandoned
their ships and exposed them; others, however, burned theirs and
hastened with us on the journey.

When our princes were entangled in delay before Tripoli, the
Lord sent such great desire of going to Jerusalem that no one could
there restrain himself. or another, but, setting out at evening against
the decrees of the princes and the custom of our army, we walked
along all that night and came on the following day to Beirut. After
this, When the narrow passages which are called The Twisted Mouth
had been suddenly seized in advance, we came in a few days and
without baggage to Acre. The King of Aere, however, afraid
that we would besiege his city, and hoping that we would with-
draw, took oath to the Count that if we captured Jerusalem, or
were in the region of Judaea for twenty days, and the King of
Babylon did not meet us in battle, or if we were able to overcome
that king, he would surrender himself and his city to us3 but that
in the meanwhile he would be our friend.

Setting forth from Aere one day at vespers, we pitched camp
by the swamps which are near Caesarea. And while, according to
custom, some ran here and there below the camp, as need de-
manded, and while others were inquiring from acquaintances where
their companions were lodged, a dove, mortally wounded by a
hawk, fell down in the midst of those runnnig about. When the
Bishop of Agde took it up, he found a letter which it was carrying.
And the sense of the letter was as follows:

“The King of Acre to the Duke of Caesarea: A canine breed,
a foolish and troublesome host without order, passed me. As you
love your law, try by yourselves and through others to hurt them;
this you can easily do, if you wish. Send this likewise to other
cities and fortresses.''

In the morning, when we were commanding the army to rest, the
letter was shown to the princes and to all the people, and (it was
manifest) how God had been kind to us, so that not even the birds
could cross through the air to harrn us, and that He likewise dis-
closed to us the secrets of our foes. Wherefore, we rendered praise
and thank to Almighty God. And thence setting forth securely and
willingly, we went forward, frequently in the front rank of the army.

and also at the end.
