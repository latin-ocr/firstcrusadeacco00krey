THE FIRST CRUSADE 187

The day of the fight had come. In the morning all partook of com-
munion and gave themselves to God, to death, if He willed, or to
the glory of the Roman church and the race of the Franks. More-
over‚ they decided about the battle as follows: that two double lines
should be made of the Count's and Bishop's people, so that the foot-
soldiers went before the knights and halted at the command of the
princes; and the knights were to follow them and guard them from
the rear. Similar arrangement was made of the people of Bohe—
mund and Tancred; the like of the people ot* the Count of Nor-
mandy and the Franks; likewise, of the people of the Duke and
the Burgundians. Moreover, trumpeters went through the city
shouting that each man should stay with the princes of his people.
It was likewise ordered that Hugh the Great‚ the Count of Flanders,
and the Count of Normandy should advance to the battle first, then
the Duke, the Bishop after the Duke, and Bohemund after the
Bishop. They assembled, each man to his own standard and kin-
folk, within the city before the gate of the bridge.

Oh, how blessed is the people whose Lord is God! Oh, how
blessed the people whom God has chosen! Oh, how unaltered His
face! How changed the army from sadness to eagerness! Indeed‚
during the past days princes and nobles went along the city streets
calling upon the aid ot* God at the churches, the common people
(walked) with bare feet weeping and striking their breasts They
had been so sad that father did not greet son, nor brother brother,
upon meeting‚ nor did they look back But now you could see
them going forth like swift horses, rattling their arms, and bran-
dishing their spears‚ nor could they bear to refrain from showing
their happiness in word and deed. But why do I grieve about many
matters? They were given the power to go forth, and what had
been agreed upon by the princes was fulfilled in order.

Meanwhile Corbara, leader of the Turks, was playing at chess
within his tent. When he received the message that the Franks
were advancing to battle, he was disturbed in mind because this
seemed beyond expectation, and he called to him a certain Turk who
had fied from Antioch, Mirdalin by name, a noble known to us for
his military prowess. “What is this?'' he said?” “Didn’t you tell
me the Franks were few and would not fight with us?” And
Mirdalin replied to him, ‘⁴1 did not say that they would not fight,
but come, and Ι will look at them and tell you if you can easily
overcome themff’

And now the third line ot' our men was advancing. When he
saw how the lines were arrayed‚ Mirdalin said to Corbara, “These

men can be killed; but they cannot be put to flightss’
