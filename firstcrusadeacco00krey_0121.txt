THE FIRST CRUSADE 103

Emperor, they were frightened even to death, weeping and lament-
ing; and the Franks were glad and gave glory to God.

The Turks, moreover, seeing that they could have no further aid
from their armies, sent a message to the Emperor that they would
willingly surrender the city, if he would permit thern to go entirely
away with their wives and children and all their substance. Then
the Emperor, full of vain and evil thinking, ordered them to de-
part unpunished‚ without any sear, and to be brought to him at
Constantinople with great assurance (of safety). These he cared
for zealously, so that he had them prepared against any damage or
hindrance from the Franks. We were engaged in that siege for
seven weeks and three days. Many of our men there received
martyrdom‚ and, glad and rejoicing, gave back their happy souls to
God. Many of the very poor died of hunger for the name of
Christ, and these bore triumphantly to heaven their robes of martyr-
dom‚ crying with one voice, “Avenge, Lord, our blood which has
been shed for Thee, who are blessed and praiseworthy forever and
ever. Amen.'’ In the meanwhile, after the city had been surren-

Nicaea. For the Duke, Bohemund, and the other princes had pre-
ceded the Count and were engaged in the labors of the siege. The
city of Nicaea is very strongly fortified by nature, as well as by
art. It has on the west a very large lake flowing up to the wall;
on the remaining three sides is a moat filled with the overflow of
certain little streams; in addition, it is encircled by walls so high
that neither the assaults of men nor the attacks of any machine
are feared. Indeed, the ballistaeffl of the neighboring towers are
so turned with reference to one another that no one can approach
without danger; however, if anyone wants to approach nearer, he
is easily overwhelmed from the top of the towers without being
able to retaliate.

Accordingly, this city, such as we have described, was besieged
by Bohemund from the north, by the Duke and the Alemanni from
the east, by the Count and Bishop of Puy from the middle, for the
Count of Normandy was not yet with us. But we believe this one
incident should not be passed overz—that when the Count was about
to encamp there with his men, the Turks, descending from the
mountains in two squadrons‚ attacked our army. Their plan, in-
deed, was that while one party of the Turks assailed the Duke and
