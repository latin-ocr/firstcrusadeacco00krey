THE FIRST CRUSADE 183

Now, do you want to know what we are saying to you? Go back
quickly, therefore, and tell your seignors that if they desire to
become Turks in everything, and wish to deny the God whom you
worship with bowed heads, and to spurn your laws, we will give
them this and enough more of lands, castles, and cities. In addition,
moreover‚ (we will grant) that none of you will longer remain a
foot-soldier, but will all be knights, just as we are; and we will
ever hold you in the highest friendship. But if not, let them know
that they will all undergo capital sentence, or will be led in chains
to Chorosan, to serve us and our children in perpetual captivity
forever.''

Our messengers speedily came back, reporting all this most cruel
race had replied. Herlwin is said to have known both tongues, and

in the fifth line was Tancred, son of Marchisus‚ with his people, and
in the sixth line was the wise man, Bohemund, with his army. Our
bishops, priests, clerics, and monks, dressed in holy vestments, came
out with us with crosses, praying and beseeching the Lord to make
us safe, guard us, and deliver us from all evil. Some stood on the

and, protected with the sign of the cross, we went forth through the
