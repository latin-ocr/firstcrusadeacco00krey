56 THE FIRsT CRUSADE

as sheep are scattered and alarmed when wolves rush upon thern.
And seeking a refuge here and there, they forgot their companions.

Emico and some of his followers continued in their ssight along
the way by which they had come. Thomas, Clarebold‚ and several of
their men escaped in flight toward Carinthia and Italy. So the
hand of the Lord is believed to have been against the pilgrims, who
had sinned by excessive impurity and fornication, and who had
slaughtered the exiled Jews through greed of money, rather than
for the sake of ⁴God’s justice, although the Jews were opposed to
Christ. The Lord is a just judge and orders no one unwillingly‚
or under compulsion, to come under the yoke of the Catholic faith.

There was another detestable crime in this assemblage of way-
faring people, who were foolish and insanely fickle. That the crime
was hateful to the Lord and incredible to the faithful is not to be
doubted. They asserted that a certain goose was inspired by the
Holy Spirit‚ and that a she-goat was not less filled by the same
Spirit. These they made their guides on this holy journey to Jeru-

following them, like beastS, believed with their whole minds that
this was the true course. May the hearts of the faithful be free
from the thought that the Lord Jesus wished the Sepulchre of His
most sacred body to be visited by brutish and insensate animals, or
that He wished these to become the guides of Christian souls,

which by the price of His own blood He deigned to redeem from

»-,the filth of idols! . . .

of the Crusades. Hugh the Great,⁷ brother of the King of France,
was the first hero to cross the sea. He landed with his force at
Durazm, a city in Bulgaria3 but imprudently ven‘turing forth with
too small an army, he was there captured by the inhabitants and
taken to the Emperor of Constantinople, where he was kept for ³2
long time, not altogether free. After him, Bohemund of Apulia?
son of Robert Guiscard of Norman extraction, journeyed with his
army· over the same route; next, Godfrey, Duke of Lorraine,⁹ passed
with a great force through Hungary. Raymond‚¹⁰ count of Prov-
ence‚ with Goths and Gascons‚ and also with Adhemar‚ Bishop of
Puy, crossed through Dalmatia. Peter the Hermu, gathering to
himself a crowd of foot-soldiers, but few knights, first passed
through Hungary; afterwards the satrap of this horde was Walter
