96 THE FIRST CRUSADE

pectedly to open the doors, thus revealing all this to Bohemund.
Amazed at the spectacle, Bohemund exclaimed: “If such riches
were mine, long ago Ι would have been lord of many lands !” The
guide answered, “And all these things the Emperor bestows upon
you today as a gift.'’ Most gladly Bohemund received them and
with many gracious thanks he left, intending to return to his rest in
the inn. But changing his mind when they were brought to him, he,
who a little before had admired them, said: “Never can I let myself
be treated with such ignominy by the Emperor. Go, take those things
and carry them back to him who sent them.’' The Emperor, know-
ing the base fickleness of the Latins, quoted this common saying,
“Let the evil return to its author.” Bohemund having heard this,
and seeing that the messengers were busily bringing these things
back to him, decided anew about the goods which he had sent
back with regret, and, like a polypus, changed in a moment, he now
showed a joyous countenance to the bearers. For he was quick, and
a man of very dishonest disposition, 35 much surpassing in malice
and intrepidity all the Latins who had crossed over 35 he was in-
ferior to them in power and wealth. But even though he thus ex-
celled all in great cunning, the inconstant character of the Latins
was also in him. Verily, the riches which he spurned at first, he
now gladly accepted. For when this man of evil design had left
his country in which he possessed no wealth at all (under the pre-
text, indeed, of adoring at the Lord's Sepulchre, but in reality en-
deavoring to acquire for himself a kingdom), he found himself in
need of much money, especially, indeed, if he was to seize the Ro-
man power. 111 this he followed the advice of his father and, so
to speak, was leaving no stone unturned.

Moreover‚ the Emperor, who understood fully his wicked inten-
tion and perverse mind, skillfully managed carevfully to remove
whatever might further Bohemund's ambitious designs. Wherefore‚
Bohemund‚ seeking a home for himself in the East and using Cretan
scheming against Cretans‚ did not obtain it. For the Emperor
‘ feared lest, after obtaining power, he would use it to place the Latin
counts under obligation to him, finally thus accomplishing easily
what he wished. But since he did not want Bohemund to surmise
that he was already discovered, the Emperor misled him by this
hope: “Not yet‚” he said, “has the time come for the thing which
you say ; 1)111 after a little it shall come about by your fortitude and Ι
111151 in me.’'

After the Emperor had bestowed upon the Gauls promises, gifts,
and honors of every kind, the next day he solemnly took his seat
on the imperial throne. Summoning Bohemund and all the counts,
