question, for this foraging journey was accomplished in a very few days.
The region actually involved was probably the valley of the Orontes, just
south and southeast of Antioch. Raymond may have derived Hispania from
Ispahan, applying the term vaguely to all the land southeast of Antioch.
This seems the most probable explanation.

1⁹ By Goths Raymond probably means the people of Toulouse and even
oi northern Spain.

²⁰ The Fatimite Caliphate had been established at Cairo in Egypt since
972 AD. In recent years they had lost most of their holdings in Syria to
the Seljuk Turks, who were attached to the Abassid Caliphate of Bagdad.
The Caliph in Egypt at this time was the vigorous Mustali (1094-1101), who
was very desirous of regaining Syria from the Seljuks. Hence, his envoys
appeared among the Crusaders at Antioch to arrange a satisfactory alliance
against the Seljuks, their common foe. The Emir, or Vizier, of the Egyp-
tian Caliph at this time was Al- Afdhal, who is mentioned later.

21 Probably Tarsus, whose possession Baldwin and Tancred disputed, and
which lies near the other two cities mentioned. The actual possession of
these places was already in the hands of the Crusaders, so that the only
object of this grant would be to forego the rights which the Emperor had
reserved in his agreement with the princes.

22 According to Anna (XI, 4-12 passim), Tetigus‚ who was in command
of the Greek force which had accompanied the Crusaders from Nicaea, was
constantly threatened by Bohemund and finally forced to fiee. Bohemund
is said to have advised his desertion on the ground that the Crusaders were
very angry with the Greeks. Anna, of course, regards the whole incident
as a part of Bohemund's deliberate scheme to take Antioch and the sur-
rounding country, in violation of his oath to the Emperor.

²3 See note 20. The “King” either refers to the Caliph or his Vizier.
Saracen titles were not clearly understood by the Latins.

²4 St. George (martyred, according to legend, at Nicomedia, April 23, 303)
was the patron saint of the region about Constantinople. The Strait, the
Arm of Saint George, was named in his honor. St. Demetrius (Proconsul
at Achaia, martyred October 8, 290) was patron saint ot' the region of Bul-
garia. St. Theodore (probably Theodore Stratolates, who died at Heraclea
in Pontus, February 7, 319) was a patron saint of Asia Minor. By Saint
Basil is probably meant the great Church Father of the East, Archbishop os
Caesarea in the early fourth century, though there are almost thirty saints
of this name in the calendar of the Eastern Church. The intervention of
these saints, recorded not only in this letter, but also in the accounts of the
Latin chroniclers‚ is an interesting example of religious psychology. The
patron saints of the West are little mentioned.

²⁸ Pirus, called also Pyrrhus, Pirrus, Pirous, Feirus, Pirus Datianus, and
Firu is, for obvious reasons, the object of great difference of opinion. The
Mohammedan writers call him an Armenian, a renegade Christian, while the
