THE FIRsT cRUSADE 39

have withdrawn from the communion 01 our belief? And the man
of sin, the son 01 perdition, will find some to oppose him. Behold,
the Gospel cries out, ‘Jerusalem shall be trodden down by the Gen-
tiles 00111 100 111005 01 100 Gentiles be fulfilled3³4 ‘Times 01 100
Gentiles’ can be understood in two ways: Either that they have
ruled over the Christians at their pleasure‚ and have gladly fre-
quented the sloughs 01 311 03500055 101 100 531151301100 01 their
lusts, and in 311 1015 03νο had no obstacle (101 they who have every-
thing according to their wish are said to have their time: there is
that saying: ‘My time is not yet come, but your time is always
re1‘21dy,'35 whence the lustful are wont to say ‘you are having your
time'). Or, again, ‘the times 01 100 Gentiles' are the fulness 01
time 101 10050 Gentiles who shall have entered secretly before
Israel shall be saved. These times, most beloved brothers, will now,
forsooth, be fulfilled, provided the might 01 100 pagans be repulsed
through you, with the co-operation 01 God. With the end 01 100
world already near, even though the Gentiles fail to be converted
to the Lord (since according to the apostle there rnust be a with-
drawal from the 13110), 11 15 first necessary, according to the proph-
ecy‚ that the Christian sway be renewed in those regions, either
through you, or others, whom it shall please God to send before
the coming 01 Αο11001151, 50 1031 100 head 01 311 evil, who is to

“Consider, therefore, that the Almighty has provided yon, per-
haps, 101 1015 purpose, that through you He may restore Jerusalem
from such debasement. Ponder, Ι beg you, how full 01 joy and de-
light our hearts will be when we shall see the Holy City restored
with your little help, and the prophet’s, nay divine, words fulfilled
in our times. Let your memory be moved by what the Lord Him-
5011 says to the Church: ‘I will bring thy seed from the East
and gather thee from the West.'³·6 God has already brought our
seed 11010 100 Ε351, 51000 10 a double way that region 01 100 Ε351
035 given the first beginnings 01 100 Church to us. But from the
West He will also gather it, provided He repairs the wrongs 01
Jerusalem through those who have begun the witness 01 100 final
saith, that is the people 01 100 West. With God’s assistance, we
think this can be done through yon.

“If neither the words 01 100 Scriptures arouse you, nor our ad-
monitions penetrate your minds, at least let 100 great suffering 01
