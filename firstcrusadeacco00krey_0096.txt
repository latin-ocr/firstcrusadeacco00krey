80 THE FIRST CRUSADE

3. Godfrey at Constantinople, (December, 1096-May‚ 1097.)

(Gesta.) Duke Godfrey was the first of all the seignors to Β

come to Constantinople with a great army. He arrived two days
before the Nativity of Our Lord and camped outside the city,
until the iniquitous Emperor ordered him to be lodged in a suburb
of the city. And when the Duke had been so lodged, he used
to send his squires, under pledge, day by day to fetch hay and
other necessities for the horses. When now they planned to go
wherever they wished, on the strength of their pledge, the evil
Emperor placed a watch upon them and commanded his Turcopoles
and Patzinaks to attack and kill them. Thereupon, when Bald-
win‚ brother of the Duke, heard of this, he placed himself in am-
bush and then :found thern killing his people. He attacked them
in great anger and, God helping‚ overcame them. Capturing sixty
of them, he killed some and presented the rest to the Duke‚ his
brother. WVhen the Emperor had heard of this, he was exceedingly
angry. Then the Duke, seeing that the Emperor was enraged,
went with his men out of the suburb and encamped outside the city.

the rest even to the gates os the city. The Duke‚ returning to his

agreement with the Emperor. The Emperor told him to cross the
Strait of St. George, and promised to have every kind of market
there, just as at Constantinople, and to distribute alms to the poor,
> upon which they could'live.

(Albert.) With his entire band of pilgrims Godfrey withdrew
to the city of Constantinople itself. There, after pitching their
tems, they lodged, a strong and powerful band, protected by armor
and all warlike equipment. And, behold, at the meeting Hugh,
Drogo, William Carpenter‚ and Clarebold‚ set free by the Emperor,
were present, rejoicing because of the arrival of the Duke and of
his multitudes, and meeting the embrace of the Duke and of the
others with many a kiss. And, likewise, the above mentioned mes-
senger of the Emperor met the Duke‚ asking him to come to the
palace of the Emperor with some of the chiefs of his army, that
he might hear the word of the King. The rest of his multitude
should remain outside the walls of the city. Scarcely had the
Duke received the message when, behold, some sti-angers from the
land of the Franks appeared by stealth in his camp. The strangers
cautioned the Duke very strongly to beware of the wiles and al-
luring appearance of the Emperor, and by no means to go to the Ern-
