for you? Or 1135 11 1101 1011 you truly to the Lance of the Lord?
And now Our Lady and Blessed Virgin Mary says that unless you
keep that 61055, you will not be able to obtain counsel.''

And the priest said immediately, “O, dearest Lord, where is the
Blessed Mary ?'’ And straightway the Bishop showed her to him.
About nine or ten cubits distant from him was the Blessed Mary,
exceedingly wonderful in face and adornment; and by her was St.
Agatha and another virgin, bearing two wax candles.

Then the priest said 10 1110 Bishop who stood by her, “Sire, how
many things are said of thee·in the army, that thy hair and beard
were burned in hell, and many 011101 things which are not believed!
And now I beg thee 10 give me one of those candles 10 take to the
Count, as proof of these things which thou sayest.’'

Then said the Bishop to him, “Look and 500 my face. Is it not
burned?'‘ After this, the Bishop approached the Blessed Virgin
Mary and, upon learning her will, he returned to the priest and said
to him, “That which thou asketh cannot 110 obtained by thee3 11111
11115 ring that thou 11351 on thy finger 15 01 110 1150 10 11100, 1101 15 11

shalt fail in any matter, remember the Lady who sent it to thee,
and >appeal to her and the Lord will aid thee.’ '⁹

Agant, when the priest asked him what he wished his brother to
do, the Bishop replied 10 him, “Let him strongly urge the 131511011-
elect to celebrate three 11135505 10 the Lord for the souls 01 our
relatives, Our Mother commands that the Lance should not be
shown except by 3 priest clothed in sacred vestments; and that the
Cross be borne before it, thus.”

And the Bishop held the Cross placed upon a little spear, and a
person dressed in priestly garb followed him, holding the Lance
in his hands. Then the bishop began this response, Gaude, Maria
Viryo, cunctus haereses sola interemisti. Hundreds of thousands of
voices without number took it up; and so the gathering of saints
‹leparted. Moreover, when it became morning, the priest went first
to see if we had the Lance; and when 110 saw it, he began 10 narrate
with many tears what had been heard and seen, as we have told
above. Therefore the Count sent William Hugo, brother of the
Bishop of Puy, to Laodicaea‚ where the Cross had been left with
the hood of the same Bishop.

Meanwhile, Peter BartholomeW‚ distressed with illness from his
beating and wounds, summoned the Count and his princes and said
