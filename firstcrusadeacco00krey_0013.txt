PREFACE

When Henry Adams sought to triangulate the progress of
modern civilization he fixed his historica] transit at Mont St.
Michel and Chartres in the days of the First Crusade and sighted
from them across the centurieS. No earlier place in the Middle
Ages would have afforded a foundation of equal breadth in its
description of society. The spiritual character of the Crusade
lent a halo to even the most commonplace details connected with
it and thus gave to them a literary immortality hitherto confined
rather narrowly to matters ot' ecclesiastical interest. The wide-
spread enthusiasm for the movement and participation in it as-
sured its commemoration not only in monuments of stone but
in a variety of writings as well. The authors of these accounts
were neither sophisticated nor highly trained in their art. The
picture of society which they drew‚ though relatively complete,
has stood forth with all the simple and stark realism of a char-
coal sketch, full of feeling, action, and scenery‚ but lacking in
finish. The polish and finish have come with the later centu-
ries. For those, however, who would understand that society
even in its more finished form, a knowledge of the preliminary
sketch is still essential.

In these lack-o-Latin days students seeking to accomplish this
find their path too much beset With linguistic obstacleS. It is to
ameliorate these difficulties that the present volume has been com-
piled. The plan of this work will be found reminiscent of
Archer’s Crusaa'e of Riclzard I and the Parallel Source Problems
of M ediaeval History. The author gratefully acknowledges in-
debtedness to both. For assistance in the preparation of these
