156 T} l E FIRST CRUSADE

01 God and of ourselvcs, by the grace 01 God we have endured
up to this time many trials and countless afflictions. Likewise,
many have already consumed all their substance in this most holy
passion. Very many of our Frankish-born, indeed, would have
undergone temporal death through hunger, had not the clemency
of God and our wealth come to their aid. Furthermore, through the
whole winter we have endured excessivo cold 101· 1116 Lord Christ,
and an immoderate abundance of rain. What some say, that in all
Syria one can scarcely endure the heat 01 1116 51111, 15 13156, 101
winter among them is like our western winter.

Moreover, when Caspianus, Emir 01 Α11110611, 11131 15, 115 prince
and lord, saw himself so closely pressed by 115, 116 56111 1115 5011,
Sensad011152⁷ by name, to 1116 prince who holds Jerusalem, and
to Rodoan, Prince ot' Aleppo and to Docap, Prince 01 Damascus. ⁷
for Ηαηιθῖηιιΐὴ.28 These five emirs, with twelve thousand chosen
Turkish knights, suddenly 631116 10 aid Antioch. But unaware of
311 11115, we had sent many of our knights among the cities and fort-
resses. We have, indeed, one hundred and sixty-five towns and
1011165565 throughout Syria within our own dominion. But 3 short
time before they came to the city, we, with seven hundred knights,
went out three leagues to meet them at a certain plain near the
Iron Bridge. God, moreover, fought t'or us, His faithful, against
them; for on this day, with the might of God, we were victorious
in fighting them, and we killed large numbers 01 1116111, God ever
fighting in our behalf. We likewise brought back to the army more
than two hundred 01 111611 heads, so that Christ’s people might
derive great joy therefrom. Moreover, the Emperor 01 Babylon²⁹
sent his Saracen envoys with letters to us in camp, and bythis means
he established peace and concord with us.

I love to tell you, dearest, what besell us this Lent. Our princes
decided to erect a 1011 before a certain gate which was situated
between our camp and the sea. The Turks, passing out through
this gate daily, used to kill our rnen on their way to the sea, for
the city 01 Antioch is five leagues distant from the 563. On this
account they sent the distinguished Bohemund and Raymond, Count
01 St. Gilles, with a company 01 only sixty knights, to the sea, thence
to 161611 sailors 10 aid in this work. However, when they were
returning to us with these sailors, an army 01 Turks, which had
assembled, 631116 upon our two unsuspecting princes and drove them
into perilous flight. In this rout, unexpected, as we have said
before, we lost more than five hundred foot-soldiers to the glory
01 God; 01 0111 knights, we lost only two for certain. Moreover,
