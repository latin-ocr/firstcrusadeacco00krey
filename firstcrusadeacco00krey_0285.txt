THE FIRST CRUSADE 261

Strange to relate, however, at this very time when the city was
practically captured by the Franks, the Saracens were still fighting
on the other side, where the Count was attacking the wall as though
the city should never be captured. But now that our men had pos-
session of the walls and towers, wonderful sights were to be seen.
Some of our men (and this was more merciful) cut off the heads
of their enemies; others shot them with arrows, so that they fell
from the towers; others tortured them longer by casting them into
the flames. Piles οἱ heads, hands, and feet were to be seen in the
streets of the city. It was necessary to pick one's way over the
bodies of men and horses. But these were small matters compared
to what happened at the Temple of Solomon, a place where religious
services are ordinarily chanted. What happened there? If I tell the
truth, it will exceed your powers of belief. So let it suffice to say this
much, at least, that in the Temple and porch of Solomon, men
rode in blood up to their knees and bridle reins. Indeed‚ it was a
just and splendid judgment of God that this place should be filled
with the blood of the unbelievers, since it had suffered so long
from their blasphemies. The city was filled with corpses and blood.
Some of the enemy took refuge in the Tower of David, and, petition-
ing Count Raymond for protection, surrendered the Tower into
his hands.

Now that the city was taken, it was well worth all our previous

labors and hardships to see the devotion of the pilgrims at the Holy .

Sepulchre. How they rejoiced and exulted and sang a new song
to the Lord! For their hearts offered prayers of praise to God,
victorious and triumphant, which cannot be told in words. A new
day, new joy, new and perpetual gladness‚ the consummation of our
labor and devotion, drew forth from all new words and new songs.
This day, Ι say, will be famous in all future ages, for it turned our
labors and sorrows into joy and exultation; this day, I say, marks
the J‘ustification of all Christianity‚ the humiliation of paganism, and

, the renewal of our saith. “This is the day which the Lord hath

made, let us rejoice and be glad in it‚’' for on this day the Lord re-
vevealed Himself to His people and blessed thern.

On this day, the Ides of July, Lord Adhemar, Bishop of Puy,
was seen in the city by many people. Many also testified that he
was the first to scale the wall, and that he summoned the knights
and people to follow him. On this day, moreover, the apostles were
cast forth from Jerusalem and scattered over the whole world.²⁴
On this same day, the children of the apostles regained the city and
fatherland for God and the fathers. This day, the Ides of July,
shall be celebrated to the praise and glory of the name of God,
