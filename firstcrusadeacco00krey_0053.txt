THE FIRST CRUSADE 37 .

11010 which we received the grace 01 redemption and the source 01
311 Christianity. Ι1 what the Lord says—namely, ‘Salvation is from
the Jews—,³28 accords with the truth, and it is true that the Lord
has 1611 us Sabaoth as seed, that we may not become like Sodom
and Gomorrah, and our seed is Christ, in whom is the salvation and
benediction 01 311 peoples, then, indeed, the very land and city in
which He dwelt and suffered is, by witness 01 1116 Scriptures, holy.
If this land is spoken 01 10 1116 sacred writings 01 1116 prophets as
the inheritance and the holy temple 01 God before ever the Lord
'walked about in it, or was revealed, what sanctity‚ what reverence
has it not acquired since God in His majesty was there clothed in
the 116511, nourished, grew up, and in bodily form there walked
about, or was carried about; and, to compress in fitting brevity all
that might be told in a long series 01 words, since there the blood 01
1116 Son 01 God, more holy than heaven and earth, was poured forth,
and His body, its quivering members dead, rested in the tomb.
What veneration do we think it deserves? If, when 1116 Lord had
but just been crucified and the city was still held by the Jews, it
was called holy by the evangelist when he says, ‘Many bodies 01 the
saints that had fallen asleep were raised; and coming forth out 01
1116 100105 31161 His resurrection, they entered into the holy city and
appeared unto many,’‘·'⁹ and by the prophet Isaiah when he says,
‘It shall be His glorious sepulchre,'³0 then, surely, with this sanctity
placed upon it by God the Sanctifier 1-11015611, no evil that may be-
1311 11 030 (16511ογ 11, and in the same way glory is indivisibly fixed
to His Sepulchre. Most beloved brethren, 11 you reverence the
source 01 that holiness and glory, 11 you cherish these shrines which
are the marks of His foot-prints on earth, 11 you seek (the way),
God leading you, God fighting in your behalf, you should strive
with your utmost efforts to cleanse the Holy City and the glory 01
the Sepulchre‚ now polluted by the concourse 01 the Gentiles, 35
much as is in their power.

“If in olden times the Maccabees attained to the highest praise
01 piety because they fought for the ceremonies ‘and the Temple,
it is also justly granted you, Christian soldierS, 10 defend the liberty
01 your country by armed endeavor. Ι1 you, likewise, consider that
the abode 01 1116 1101)] apostles and any other saints should be striven
101 with such effort, why do you 1611156 10 1650116 the Cross, the
Blood, the Tomb? Why do you 1611156 10 visit them, to spend the
price 01 your lives in rescuing thern? You have thus 131 waged
unjust wars, at one time and another; you have brandished mad
weapons to your mutual destruction, 101 00 011161 reason than
covetousness and pride, as a result 01 which you have deserved
