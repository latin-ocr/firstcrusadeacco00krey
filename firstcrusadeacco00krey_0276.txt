252 THE FIRST CRUSADE

crowding and haste that the men pushed one another into it, and
many baggage animals and cattle perished in it. And so when
the pool was filled with the crowd and with the bodies of dead
animals, the stronger, even at the price of death, forced their way
to the very opening in the rocks through which the water flowed,
while the weak got only the water which had already been con-
taminated. Many sick people fell down by the fountain‚ with
tongues so parched that they were unable to utter a word; with
open mouths they stretched forth their hands toward those who
had water. In the field were many horses, mules, cattle, and sheep,
most of the animals without strength enough to move. And when
they had become parched and died because of extreme thirst, they
rotted where they had long stood, and there was a most sickening
stench throughout the camp. Because of such affliction it was neces-
sary to fetch water a distance of two or three leagues, also to drive
the cattle to distant watering places. When the Saracens noticed
that our people were going unarmed to the watering places through
the dangerous passes in the hills, they lay in wait for them in am—
bush. They killed many of them and drove away the flocks and
herds. The situation was so bad that when any one brought foul
water to camp in vessels, he was able to get any price that he cared
to ask, and if any one wished to get clear water, for five or six
mmmmm he could not obtain enough to satisfy his thirst for a single
day. wine, moreover, was never, or very rarely, even mentioned.

t, In addition, the heat, the dust, and the wind increased their thirst,

as though this was not bad enough in itself. But why say so much
about these troubles? None‚ or few, were mindful ot' the Lord,
or of such work as was needed to capture the eity; nor did they
take heed to beseech the Lord’s favor. And thus we did not recog—
nize God in the midst of our affliction‚ nor did He show favor to
the ungrateful.

Meanwhile, messengers carne to camp, announcing that our ships
had arrived at joppa and that the sailors demanded that a guard
be sent to hold the tower of Joppa and to give them protection at
the port3 for the town of Joppa had been destroyed except the
castle, and that was nearly in ruins, with the exception of one tower.
However‚ there is a harbor there, and it is the one nearest to Jeru-
salem, being about one day’s journey distant. All of our people
rejoiced when they heard the news of the ships, and they sent out
Count Galdemar, surnamed Carpinel‘lus, accompanied by twenty
knights and about fifty footmen. Later, they· sent Raymond Piletus
with fifty knights and William of Sabran with his followers.

As Galdemar and his contingent approached the plains that are
