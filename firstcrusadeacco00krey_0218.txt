196 THE FIRST CRUSADE

Count of Flanders, and all the rest sent the most noble knight Hugh
the Great to the Emperor at Constantinople (with a message) to
come and receive the town and fulfil the agreements which he had
with thern. He went and never afterward returned. After all
this had been done, all our leaders assembled and held a council as
to how they could successfully lead and rule over this multitude
until they should have accomplished the march to the Holy Sepul-
chre, for which they had already up to this point suffered so many
dangers. It was decided in the council that they should not yet
dare to enter the land of the pagans, because in the summer time it

who were unwilling to receive Christianity. And when this had
been accomplished, our Franks returned with great joy to their
former camp.

But on the third day they went out and carne to a certain city
near them, Marra by name. Moreover, there were gathered there
many Turks and Saracens from the city of Aleppo, and from all
the cities and towns which were around it. The barbariam, accord-
ingly, carne out against us to do batle, and our men, thinking
to struggle with thern in fighting, forced them to flight; but they,
returning, attacked our men from time to time throughout the whole
