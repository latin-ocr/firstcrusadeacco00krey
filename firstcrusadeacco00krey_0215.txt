THE FIRST CRUsADE 193

But taking a stand on another hill opposite the citadel, we guarded
the road passing between the two armies down to the city, lest
many more of them break in upon us. Fighting night and day,
within and without, we forced thern to enter the gates of the citadel
which led them to the city, and to return to their camp. Accordingly,
when they saw that they could do no harm on that side, they sur-
rounded us all about, so that none of our men could go out or come
to us. As a result of this, we were all so destitute and affiicted that
many of our men, dying of starvation and many other wants, killed
and ate our famished horses and asses.

But meanwhile, by the most kind compassion of Almighty God,
who comes to our aid, and is watchful in our behalf‚ we found the
Lance of the Lord by which the side of our Saviour was pierced
at the hands of Longinus& St. Andrew the apostle thrice appeared
to a certain servant of God and pointed out where the Lance lay
buried in the church of St. Peter, chief of the apostleS. We were so
comforted and strengthened by finding it, and by many other divine
revelations‚ that we, who before had been afflicted and timid, were
then most boldly and eagerly urging one another to battle.

Accordingly, on the vigil of the apostles, Peter and Paul, after
we had been besieged for three weeks and four dayS‚ we placed
our trust in God and, having confessed all our iniquities, sought the
gates of the city from which we went out with the whole army,
ready for battle. We were so few that they were sure that we were
not fighting against them, but rather fleeing. However, when all
our men were ready, and the lines of foot-soldiers, as well as of
knights, had been definitely formed, we boldly sought out with the
Lance of the Lord (the points) where their valor and endurance
was greatest; and from the first stand of battle we forced them to
fiee. However, as is their custom, they began to scatter themselves
everywhere, and, by occupying hills and seizing roads wherever they
could, they wanted to encircle us. But the grace and mercy of God
so aided us, who had been instructed against their wiles and strata-
gems by many battles‚ that we, who were very few in comparison
with them, forced them all together into one body ; and God’s right
hand fighting with us, we forced them, so gathered‚ to flee and
abandon their camp with all that was in it. When we had con-
quered them, after pursuing them all day and killing very many
of their knights, we returned to the city, happy and rejoicing.
Moreover, a certain Emir who was in the aforesaid citadel with a
thousand men surrendered to Bohemund‚ and at his hand they un-
animously yielded to the ¹Christian saith. And thus our Lord Jesus
Christ has bound the city of Antioch to the Roman religion and

jfaith.
