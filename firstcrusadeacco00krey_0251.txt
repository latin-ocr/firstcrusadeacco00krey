THE FIRST CRUSADE 229

and other statements like it, a certain Syrian, who was a Christian,
said to me ‘Be of good spirit, and see that you weep no longer. Re-
cently Ι was before the doors of the church of the Blessed Mary,
Mother of the Lord, and a cleric, clothed in white garments, ap-
peared to me. When Ι asked him who he was, or whence he came,
he replied, “I arn Mark‚ the evangelist, and Ι come from Alexandria;
and I turned hither because of the Church of the Blessed Mary.''
And again when I asked him where he was going, he said, “Our
Lord is at Antioch and has sent word to all His disciples to come
there, since the Franks are due to fight with the Turks, and we
will be their protection.''' And when he had said this, he went
away!

“But since Ι would place little faith in these words, nor cease
from grief or tears, the same Syrian said to me, ‘Know‚ in the
Gospel of the blessed Peter it is written that the Christian host which
shall take Jerusalem shall first have been shut up in Antioch. Nor
can they thence go forth until they shall have found the Lance of >
the Lord.' '’

And the priest added, “If you doubt any of this, let the fire be
built; and in the name of God and with the witness of these people,
Ι will go through the midst of it.’'

Then another priest‚ Stephen, surnamed Valentine‚ a man of
great integrity and good life, came forth and said, “The Lord Jesus
Himself spoke to me in the very midst of the suffering which was
at Antioch, and promised in the presence of His most Blessed
Mother, the Virgin Mary, that on the fifth day to come He would
be merciful to His people and complete their different undertakings,
if they would return to Him with their whole heart. And on that
day the Holy Lance was found; therefore I believe that the prom-
ises of the Lord were fulfilled. If you doubt any of this, as soon
as I saw this vision Ι offered the Bishop of Puy as proof of it
to go through fire in the presence of the whole multitude, if he
wished, or to throw myself from the highest tower. And I still
make this very offer to you.''

Moreover the Bishop of Agde, carne forth and said, “Whether Ι
saw this in my sleep or not, Ι know not for certain; God knows.
A man, dressed in white, and holding the Lance of the Lord, this
Lance, I say, in his hands, came and stood before me and said to
me, ‘Dost thou believe this to be the Lance of the Lord ?’

“And I replied: ‘1 do, Lord.'

“I had hesitated somewhat about it, but after he 'had sternly ex-
acted this (answer) from me a second and a third time, Ι said to
him: ‘I believe, Lord, that this is the Lance of my Lord Jesus

Christ? And after this he left me.’'
