THE FIRST CRUSADE 21

and in profusion‚ were calculated to shatter the ranks of the Cru-
saders and usually did great damage to the less heavily
armored foot-soldiers. If this device failed to open up the ranks,
they scattered in seigned ssight, hoping thus to draw the Crusaders'
after them in disorganized pursuit, when it was an easy matter to
turn and cut them down. The Emperor Alexius gave the Cru-
saders some very valuable advice on these matters. Actual ex-
perience proved an even more effective teacher, so that the Crusaders
regularly placed a strong line at their rear and on the fianks, as well
as in front, and did not pursue the enemy until they were actually
in rout.

To the &Vesterners siege warfare was less well known than open
fighting. In most of VVestern Europe there was little of the heavy
masonry of Roman days, such as had never gone out of use in the
East. The Italians had had relatively more experience than the
people north of the Alps, but both had much to learn. The military
engineers of Constantinople gave the Crusaders some important
lessons in siege-craft at Nicaea. The development of more power-
ful hurling engines for both stones and' arrows became a necessity.
These were of two kinds: the ballistae, used to shoot large arrows
or bolts with great force, and the Ferraria, which hurled large
stones. The motive power was provided by the torsion of twisted
ropes or the sudden release of a heavy counter-poise‚ and great
ingenuity was exercised to increase their force. During the whole
expedition, however, they were not developed sufficiently to make
any considerable impression upon the walls. They were chiefly
effective in clearing the walls of defenders‚ which facilitated other
siege operations. Battering rams of various kinds were also used,
and, as a protection for the manipulatom, mantlets made of wattl'e‘d
stakes were constructed. Undermining the walls was an operation
also resorted to, but the most effective devices in overcoming
strongly fortified towns were the great movable towers and the
blockade. The first was used successfully both at Marra and Jeru-
salem, the latter at Nicaea and Antioch. These are fully described
in the text (see pages 256, 205, 105). Scaling ladders of wood were
of subsidiary value, but played a part at Marra and Jerusalem and
especially at Caesarea. In all these operations there was a great
demand for skilful engineers‚ as well as for unskilled labor. It
is significant that Greek engineers were employed at Nicaea and
Antioch‚ Italian at Antioch and Jerusalem. The Westerners had
much to learn, it is true, but that they were quick to do so is shown
not only by their success at Jerusalem, but also by the stronger
castles and fortifications which appeared in VVestern Europe during
the twelfth century.
