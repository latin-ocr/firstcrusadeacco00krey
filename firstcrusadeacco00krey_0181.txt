THE FinsT CRL'SADE 159

Upon his arrival, our princes went forth from camp, and that day,
God being their helpes, with seven hundred knights and a few foot-
soldiers they defeated twelve thousand Turks with their King, put
them to fiight, and killed many of them. Our men regained not a
few horses from that battle, and returned rejoicing with victory.
Growing stronger and stronger, therefore, from that day our men
took counsel with renewed courage as to how they might besiege
the western gate which cut off access to the sea, wood, and fodder.
By common agreement, therefore, Bohemund and the Count of St.
Gilles went to the coast to fetch those who were staying there.
Meanwhile, those who had remained to look after the possessions,
seeking to acquire a name for themselveS, went out incautiously one
day after breakfast, near that western gate from which they were
ingloriously repulsed and put to fiight. On the third day after
this, Bohemund and the Count of St. Gill'es‚ on their way back, sent
word to the princes of the army to meet them, (intending) together
to besiege the gate. However‚ since the latter delayed for a short
time, Bohemund and the Count of St. Gilles were beaten and put to
flight. Therefore all our men, grieving and ‘bewailing their dis-
grace, as well, for a thousand of our men fell that day, formed
their lines and defeated and put to flight the Turks, who offered
great resistance. On this day, moreover, almost fourteen hundred
of the enemy perished both by weapons and in the river, which was
swollen with winter rains.

And so, when this had been accomplished, our men began to
built the fortress, which they strengthened, also, with a double
moat and a very strong wall, as well as with two towers. In it they
placed the Count of St. Gilles with machine men and bowmen.
Oh, with what great labor we established the fortress! One part
of our army served the eastern front, another looked after the
camp, while all the rest worked on this fortress. Of the latter, the
machine men and bowmen kept watch on the gate; the rest, in>-
cluding the princes themselves, did not stop in the work of carry-
ing stones, and building the wall. Why recount the trials of
many kinds, which, even if passed over in silence, are sufficiently
evident in themselves—hunger, intemperate weather‚ and the de-
56111011 of faint-hearted soldiers? The more bitter they were, the
more ready our men were in enduring them. Yet, indeed, We think
that we should bv no means pass in silence the fact that on 3 66113111
day the Tur‘ks pretended that they would surrender the city and
carried the deception so far as to receive some of our men among
them, and several of their men came out to us. While this was
going on in this manner, they, like the faithless people that they
