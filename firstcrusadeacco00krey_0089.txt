THE FIRST CRUSADE 73

(Albert.) The Emperor was moved by compassion on hearing
this humble narrative and ordered two hundred gold besants to be
given to Peter; of that money which was called tartaron he dis-
bursed one measure for his army. After that, Peter retired from
the conference and from the palace of the Emperor. Although un-
der the kind protection of the Emperor, he rested only five days in
the fields and lands near Constantinople, where Walter the Penni-
less had likewise pitched his tents. Becoming companions from that
very day, thereafter their troops, arms, and all necessary provisions
were J'oined together. Next, after five days, they moved their tents
and, with the aid of the Emperor, passed-by boat over the Strait
of St. George. Entering the confines of Cappadocia, they advanced
through mountainous country into Nicomedia and there passed the
night. After this, they pitched camp at the port called Civitote.
There merchants were constantly bringing ships laden with supplies
of wine, corn, oil, and barley, and with abundance of cheese, selling
all to the pilgrims with J'ust measure.

While they were rejoicing in this abundance of necessities and
were resting their tired bodies, there carne messengers from the most

course of two months, feasting in peace and joy, and sleeping secure
from all hostile attacks.

And so two months later, having become wanton and unrestrained
because of ease and an inestimable abundance of food, heeding not

the voice of Peter, but against his will, they entered into the region ,³³
of the city of Nicaea and the realms of Soliman.⁸ They took as .

plunder cattle, sheep, goats, the herds of the Greek servants of the
Turks, and carried them off to their fellows. Peter, seeing this,
was sorrowful in heart, knowing that they did it not with impunity.
Whereupon he often admonished thern not to seize any more booty
contrary to the counsel of the Emperor, but in vain did he speak to
a foolish and rebellious people. . . .

But the Teutons, seeing that affairs turned out so well for the
Romans and the Franks, and that they returned unhindered so many
times with their booty, were inflamed with an inordinate desire for
plunder. About three thousand foot-soldiers were collected and
about two hundred knights. . . . ¹

And thus, after all the stronghold had been captured and its in-
