the Latin leaders on the First Crusade none understood the problems be-
fore them better than Bohemund‚ for he had had dealings not only with
the Greeks, but with the Saracens in Sicily. Because he was born of an
early marriage, his mother being a woman of obscure Norman origin, he
had inherited only the principality of Otranto, while his younger brother,
Roger, son of a Lombard princess, succeeded to his father’s title. The Cru—
sade, therefore, offered him an opportunity for improving his fortune.

⁹Godfrey of Bouillon (1065(?)-1100), so called from the feuda] princi-
pality of that name which he held before he became Duke of lower Lor-
raine. Through his mother, Ida, he was grandson of Duke Godfrey II and
had been designated by the latter as his successor. Henry IV, the Emperor,
withheld this duchy from him for some years. The young Godfrey‚ how-
ever, won the Emperor's favor by valiant aid against the Pope and other
enemies, and in 1082 he received the duchy. It was said of Godfrey that he
was the first to storm the walls of Rome in the Emperor’s attack upon the
papal city. Nevertheless, after some years, Godfrey was won over to the
papal side of the Investiture Struggle and was among the first to take the
Crusader’s vow.

10 Raymond of Toulouse (d. 1105), or St. Gilles, had become count of
Toulouse in 1086. He was a religious enthusiast and had probably taken
part in the warfare against the Mohammedans in Spain before the First
Crusade. Without doubt, he was the first important secular person to vol-
unteer for the Crusade. He made careful disposal of his possessions before
going, and on the expedition he was reputed to be the wealthiest of the
leaders, For some cause he had lost the use of one eye, a circumstance
which may have played a part in his position among the leaders, as it did
later in legend.

1{Robert of Normandy (1054(?)-1135), eldest son of William the Con-
quero'r‚ had enjoyed a rather turbulent career as Duke of Normandy for
some years before 1096. Early recognized as his father's successor in Nor-
mandy, he twice revolted against his father and was twice forced into exile.
Upon the Conqueror’s death, he released many political prisoners, among
them being his contentious uncle, Odo, Archbishop of BayeuX. He was
engaged in warfare with his brothers, william Rufus and Henry, when the
call for the Crusade was announced. Thereupon, he made peace with his
brothers, mortgaged his duchy to William Rufus, and started on the Cru-
sade. He had already given proof οἱ those traits which marked him on the
expedition—great physical courage‚ love of pleasure, and lack of ambition.

1⁴R0bert οἱ Flanders (d. 1111) became Count of Flanders upon the death
of his father in 1093. He was comparatively young and adventurous when
he started on the Crusade. His fame rests chiefly upon his exploits as a
Crusader.
