38 THE FIRST CRUSADE

61611131 death and sure damnation. W'e now hold out to you wars
which contain the glorious reward 01 martyrdom, which will re—
tain that title 01 praise now and forever.

“Let us suppose, 101 1116 moment, that Christ was not dead and
buried, and had never lived any length 01 time in Jerusalem. Sure-
ly, 11 311 11115 were lacking, this fact alone ought still to arouse you
to go to the aid 01 1116 land and city—the fact that ‘Qut 01 Zion shall
go forth the law and the word 01 ]611ον311 110111 Jerusaleml‘31 11
311 11131 there is of Christian preaching has flowed from the 101111-
13111 01 Jerusalem, its streams, whithersoever spread out over the
whole world, encircle the hearts of the Catholic multitude, that they
may consider wisely what they owe such a well-watered 10111113111.
If rivers return to the place whence they have issued only to flow
forth again, according to the saying 01 Solomon,32 it ought to seem
glorious to you to be able to a'pply a new cleansing to this place,
whence it is certain that you received the cleansing of baptism and
the witness 01 your 131111.

“And you ought, furthermore, to consider with the utmost de-
liberation, if by your labors, God working through you, it should
occur that the Mother 01 61111161165 should flourish anew to the wor-
ship 01 Christianity, whether, perchance, He may not wish other
regions 01 1116 East to be restored to the 131111 against the approach-
ing time of the Antichrist.33 For it is clear that Antichrist is to do
battle not with the Jews, not with the Gentiles; but, according to
the etymology 01 1115 1131116, He will attack Christians. And 11 Α1111-
6111151 finds there no Christians (just as at present when scarcely
any dwell there), no one will be there to oppose him, or whom he
may rightly overcome. According to Daniel and Jerome, the in-
terpreter of Daniel, he is to fix his tents on the Mount 01 Olives;
and it is certain, 101 1116 apostle teaches it, that he will sit at Jeru-
salem in the Temple 01 1116 Lord, as though he were God. And
according to the same prophet, he will first kill three kings 01
Egypt, Africa, and Ethiopia‚ without doubt 101 111611 Christian saith.
This, indeed, could not at all be done unless Christianity was estab-
lished where now is paganism. If, therefore, you are zealous in the
practice 01 holy battles‚ in order that, just as you have received the
seed 01 knowledge of God 110111 Jerusalem, you may in the same
way restore the borrowed grace, so that through you the Catholic
name may be advanced to oppose the perfidy 01 1116 Α11116111151 and
the Antichristians—then‚ who can not conjecture that God, who has
exceeded the hope 01 311, will' consume, in the abundance 01 your
courage and through you as the spark, such a thicket 01 paganism
as to include within His law Egypt, Africa, and Ethiopia‚ which
