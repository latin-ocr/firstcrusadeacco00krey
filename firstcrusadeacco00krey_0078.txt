62 THE FIRST CRUSADE

their weapons there and, taking up again their pilgrim’s staves,
ignominiously returned to their homes. This desertion debased
them before God and man, and it redounded to their shame. ζ’

D. Bohemund’s march to Constantinople. (October 26, 1096-April
10, 1097.)

(Gesta.) But Bohemund, powerful in battle, who was engaged
in the siege of Amalfi on the sea of Salerno, heard that a countless
host of Christians from among the Franks had come to go to the
Sepulchre of the Lord, and that they were prepared for battle
against the pagan horde. He then began to inquire closely what
fighting arms these people bore, and what sign of Christ they·-
carried on the way, or what battle-cry they shouted. The following
replies were made to him in order: “They bear arms suitable for
battle; on the right shoulder‚ or between both shoulders, they wear
the cross of Christ; the cry, ‘God wills it! God wills it! God wills
it!’ they shout in truth with one voice.'' Moved straighway by thc
Holy Spirit, he ordered the most precious cloak which he had with
him cut to pieces‚ and straightway he had the whole of it made into
crosses. Thereupon‚ most of the knights engaged in that siege
rushed eagerly to him, so that Count Roger remained almost alone.

Returning again to his own land, Lord Bohemund diligently pre-
pared himself to undertake in true earnest the journey to the Holy
Sepulchre. At length, he crossed the sea with his army. With him
were Tancred, son of Marehisus‚20 'Richard of Principati‚ and
Rainuff, his brother, Robert of Anse, Herman of Cannae, Robert
of Surda Valley,21 Robert, son of Tostanus, Hunfred, son of Raoul,
Richard, son of Count Rainulf, the Count of Rosciyno-ffloss with his
brothers, Boellus of Chartres‚ Albered of Cagnano, and Hunt'red of
Mt. Scaglioso. All of these crossed the sea to do service for Bohe-
mund and landed in the region of Bulgaria‚ where they found a
very great abundance of grain, wine, and bodily nourishment.
Thence descending into the valley of Andronopoli,²³ they> waited
for his forces, until all had likewise crossed the sea. Then the wise
Bohemund ordered a council with his people‚ comforting and ad· Δ
monishing all (with these words) ε “Seignors, take heed all of you,
for we are pilgrims of God. We ought, therefore, to be better and
more humble than before. Do not plunder this land, since it be-
longs to Christians, and let no one, at the cost of blessing, take
more than he needs to eat.''

Departing thence, we journeyed hrough great plenty from villa ’

to villa, city to city, fortress to fortress, until we reached Castoria.
There we solemnly celebrated the nativity of the Lord. We re-
