18 THE FIRST CRUSADE

right exercised by all the great feudal vassals. There were expres-
sions of value common to all Europe—eg, the liber, or pound,
which equalled 20 solidi, or shillings, which equalled 240 denarii, or
pennies; and a marc which -equalled two-thirds of a liber, or 160
denarii. Eut when these ternis were applied to coins in actual cir-
culation, their meaning varied with the character of the coin in-
volved. The coin in most general use was the denarius, or penny.
This was usually of silver‚ but might be made of an alloy, or some-
times of copper alone. A large and a small denarius were known,
the latter often called an obol. The intrinsic value of the coin
varied somewhat according to the particular mint at which it was
coined, weight constituting‚ on the whole, the safest method of
determining value. Raymond mentions seven different denarii
from a limited region of the west as current in the army. Varia—
tion was caused by debasement through coin-clipping and kindred
practices, which, however, appear to have been less common
at this time than later. In vier of such facts, generalizations
about monetary matters are exceedingly hazardous. However, it
is usually saie to assume when XVestern coins are mentioned that
denarii are meant. Solidi, liberi, and marci are moneys of account,
convenient in expressing large sums of denarii. The ordinary silver
denarius weighed from 20 to 24 gr. as compared with the American
dime which weighs 385 gr. In the East the Crusaders met with
gold coins, the besant and perperus of Constantinople‚ and the gold
besant of the Saracens. The besam of Constantinople weighed
about 65 gr. as compared with the American gold coinage, which
weighs about 25 gr. per dollar. The perperus, called also pur-
puratus, yperperzts, yperperon, and perpre, is less well known. Its
value‚ as stated by the author of the Gesta, was equal to 15 solidi,
or 180 denarii. The gold besam of the Saracens, a Latin term for
the Arabian dinor, was about equal in weight and intrinsic value to
the besant οἱ Constantinople. In seeking the modern equivalents
of these coins, it is necessary to bear in mind the relative value of
gold and silver in the middle ages. Another coin encountered in
the East was the tarta-ron, which appears to have been a cheap
copper coin of sornewhat varying value.

From an economic point of view the First Crusade must be re-
garded as one of the most important factors in transforming the·
basis of European exchange from the natural to the monetary. The
change was by no means complete with the end ot' the Crusades,
but a long step had been taken toward that goal when the first of
these expeditions was launched. Money was necessary to defray
the ordinary living expenses on the march, and the Crusaders re-
