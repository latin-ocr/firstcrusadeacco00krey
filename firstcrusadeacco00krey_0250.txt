228 THE FIRST CRUSADE

“The Lord again said, ‘What have Ι said to thee? Answer.’

“And I knew nothing. When He pressed me to answer some
of the things which He had said, Ι replied, ‘Lord, Ι know nothing.’

“And the Lord said, ‘Go and tell what thou knowest‚ and what
thou knowest will be sufficient for thee.'

“W'hen, however, Ι would have made this known to the brethren,
some began to say that they would never believe that God spoke to
such a man, that He passed our princes and bishops and revealed
Himself to a peasant man; whence they likewise doubted about the
Lance. &Vherefore we called together those brethren to whom the
Lance had been revealed at one time and another, and after this,
Arnulf, chaplain of the Count of Normandy who was, as it were,
the head of the unbelievers ;18 and we asked him why he doubted.

&Vlien he said that the Bishop of Puy had doubted it, a certain

the necessaries of life. When Ι heard that Antioch had been
taken, and that our men in the city were held in such a stage of
siege that none of them dared to go in or out, except by stealth‚ and
that many other evils threatened the besieged (mostly false reports
which the Saracens and Turks added to the true evils), I was doubt-
ful of my secular life, and fied to a certain church where I knelt be-

began to appeal through her for the mercy of God3 and I did this for
some days, remaining without food and saying to her: Ὁ· dearest
Lady, these are pilgrims who have left all their little ones, their
wives, and all their dear ones for the name of thy Son and for
thee. They have come hither from distant regions and are fighting
