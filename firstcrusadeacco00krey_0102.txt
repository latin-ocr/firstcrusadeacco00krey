84 THE FIRST CRUSADE

The Duke graciously agreed, provided hostages were given to whom
he could trust his life and safety; then without doubt he would
come to the Emperor, freely to speak by word of mouth.

Hardly had the legates of the Emperor departed after this re-
sponse of the Duke, when, behold, certain other legates, coming
to the same Duke from Bohemund, greeted him, speaking thus:
“Bohemund, the most wealthy prince of Sicily and Calabria, asks
that you by no means enter into peace with the Emperor; but that
you withdraw to Adrianople and Philippopolis, cities of the Bul-

and his followers with the privilege of buying all necessaries. When
the Duke learned that these promises of the Emperor had been
made in the form of a decree, he moved his camp from the wall of
the city by the advice of his council and again withdrew across the
bridge to take lodging in the fortified dwellings on the strait. He
admonished all his people to remain at peace, and to purchase what-
ever was necessary without disturbance.

On the following day, he commanded Conon, Count of Mon-
taigu, and Baldwin of Burg, most noble men and skilled in speak-
