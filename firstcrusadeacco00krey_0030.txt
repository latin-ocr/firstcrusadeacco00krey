14 THE FIRST CRUSADE

ners and customs of that time will find enough pleasure and profit
in this treatment, it is hoped, to repay him for whatever confusion
the variety of expressions may create. A brief explanation of some
of the more distinctive habits in the terminology of the period
may be of use.

Ι. Names of persons and places.

The names of the sanie persons and the same places are spelled
in many different ways not only by the different writers, but often,
too, by the same writer. While this is more true of Eastern persons
and places, it is, also, quite generally true with regard to the XVest, a
revelation of how much of the world was strange to the people of
eleventh century Europe. It must be reinembered, however,
that dictionaries, gazetteers, and similar works of reference, which
greet the twentieth century person at every turn, were virtually un-
known, while newspapers and other periodicals, which serve to
standardize so much of life today, did not then exist. Almost the
only common descriptions of the world known at that time were
those contained in either the classical writings or in those of the
Church fathers. It is not strange, therefore, to find the names of
old Roman provinces and cities applied to places by some of the
more highly educated writers, such as Ekkehard, Raoul, or Guibert.
Less trained writers—and most of our writers fall within this
category—had to trust chiefly to their powers of hearing and their
ability to reproduce in writing what they heard. They had to follow
their own rules of phonetic spelling and, considering the difficulties
under which they labored‚ their results deserve genuine admiration.
In order to avoid undue confusion, a uniform spelling has been
adopted for the names of places which have been identified. In
most cases the mediaeval name has been employed, but where the
modern equivalent is much better known that form has been chosen.

The identification of the places mentioned by the writers presents
considerable difficulty at times. It would be asking almost too much
to expect the chroniclers to recall vividly and correctly both the
name and exact location of all the strange places which they mention
five or more years after they had passed through them. Important
towns and places in which they spent some time, or with which
they were able to associate some dramatic event, are usually located
quite accurately; other lesser places cannot always be positively
identified. All places mentioned whose location can be identified
appear on the accompanying maps. The others, whose location is

uncertain, have been italicized.
