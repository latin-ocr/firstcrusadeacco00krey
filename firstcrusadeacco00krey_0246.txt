224 THE FIRST CRUSADE

April), they held a council and said: “It is very good to carry out
the march to Jerusalem with the new fruits.'’

(Raymond.) NVhen, as we said, our army was laboring great-
ly in the siege of ArchaS, it was announced to us that the Pope of
the Turks was coming to battle against us3 and since he was of the
race of Mohammed‚ innumerable people followed him. Accord-
ingly, the army was commanded that all should prepare themselves
for battle. So they sent the Bishop of Albara to the Duke and the
Count of Flanders, who were besieging Gibellum. This is a fortress
above the sea, about half way between Antioch and the fortress of
Archas, two days distant from both. When they had received the
message, they gave up the siege and came quickly to us. Meanwhile
(the report) was found to be false. The Saracens had made it up
so that, while our men were thereby terrified, the besieged might be
able to gain a little rest.

So when our armies had been joined, the men of the Count’s
party began to show the sleek horses and the riches which
God had given them in the regions of the Saracens because they
had exposed themselves to death for God; but the others held forth
their poverty. At this time it was preached that the people should
give a tithe of all they had taken, because there were many poor in
the army and many sick. It was commanded that they should
render a fourth part to their priests whose masses they attended,
a fourth part to the Bishop‚ and the other two parts to Peter the
Hermit, whom they had placed in charge of the poor of both
clergy and people. And thus he received two parts ; to wit, one part
for those who were of the clergy, and the other for those who were
of the people. Therefore God so multiplied our army in horses,
mules, camels‚ and the other necessities of life that it became a
marvel to us and a dream. And thus from the wealth of possessions
there arose a dispute and arrogance among the princes, so that
those who loved God dearly desired much more that want and
fearful battles should threaten.

The King of Tripoli wished to give us fifteen thousand gold
coins of Saracen minfflng, besides horses, mules, and many robes,
and then tributes each year much greater than this. One gold coin,
forsooth, was at this-time worth eight or nine solidi of our money.
This was our money: Pictavini‚ Cartenses, Manses‚ Luccenses,
Valansa‘ni, M elyorienses, and Poyesi, two of which (were offered)
for one of the others.¹⁶ But that lord of Gibellum‚ afraid that he
might again be besieged, sent to our princes five thousand gold
coins, horses, mules, and much wine; then we had food enough.
And not only did these send us gifts‚ but also those from many
