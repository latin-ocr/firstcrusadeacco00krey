6 THE FIRST CRUSADE

These letters‚³ of which fourteen are here translated and distrib-
uted at their appropriate places in the narrative, constitute the most
important sources of our knowledge of the events which they de-
scribe. The authors are all men of prominence and responsibility.
Two of the letters are from popes. One is from the Emperor
Alexius. Five are from the leaders of the Crusade and may be re-
garded as official reports of progress, while the remaining four,
though also the works of leaders, are of a more personal nature.
The two letters of Stephen ot' Blois to his wife. Adele, are among
the literary genis of the period. In addition to the responsible char-
acter of their writers, the letters have the further merit of greater
proximity both of time and place to the events which they narrate.
The emotions of the moment grip the writers irresistibly, beyond the
power of epistolary formality to efface and thus lend a vividness
which the later chronicles sometimes lack. Our chief regret is that
there are not more of them.

IV. CHRONICLES

The interest of the world in the events of the First Crusade
could not be satisfied by letters alone. Numerous motives combined
to keep this interest inflamed. Patriotic pride in the achievements
of countrymen, natural enjoyment of the marvelous and adven-
tumus, the continued need of both men and money to insure the
permanence of the conquest, and, no less, the pardonable pride of the
Crusaders themselves in preserving the memory of their deeds—
all these influences tended to the telling and the retelling of the
story. Book-making in itself offered little inducement, for the ab-
sence of publishing houses and the lack ot' copyright laws denied
prospective authors hope either of fame or wealth. Publishing‚ if
the multiplication of copies by the laborious process of hand-writing
may be so called, was done chiefly in the scriptoria of monasteries
or episcopal schools. But parchment was expensive‚ and only the
clerics could write. Ordinarily the military exploits of contem-
porary men seemed too ephemeral to justify description. How-
ever, the Crusade was a different matter in thatssits exploits‚
though largely military and material, nevertheless had a deep
religious significance. Urban's remark at Clermont‚ that the re-
covery of the Holy Land would be a deed comparable to those
of the Maccabees, was not forgotten. The thought that he was
really adding a chapter to Sacred History served to carry more than
one writer over depressing periods of discouragement to the suc-
cessful completion of his history of the expedition. These varied
motives, both sacred and profane, combined to inspire the com-
