stunned at the splendor 01 1115 1101116, 116 53111 10 1116, ‘A much more
beautiful one is being prepared 101 11166 to-morrow.' And with
these words he disappeared.'’

Moreover, it happened on the same day on which Anselm had
recounted this to several people that he was proceeding to battle
against the Saracens. They had gone out secretly 110111 1116 10111655
31161 wanted to come up to our tents to steal something there, or to
hurt someone. But when this fight had grown great on both sides
and Anselm was resisting bravely, he was struck on the head by a
stone from a hurling engine; and thus he departed 110111 11115 world

Here a legate came 10 115 110111 1116 King 01 Babylon, who along
with him had sent back 10 115 our legates whom he had held captive
101 3 year. He was hesitating whether to make friendship with
us or with the Turks. We were willing to agree with him in this
way: 11 116 would give us help from Jerusalem, or 11 116 would
give us Jerusalem with what pertained 10 11, we would give him all
his cities which the Turks had taken from him, when we shoulJ
capture them. The other cities 01 1116 Turks, however, which were

111611, whom he worshipped. They would also accept his coins and
would pay a certain tribute, and they would do many other things

we were few, and that the Emperor Alexius was hostile 10 115 10

and other reasons, therefore, the Emir had detained our envoys as
captives 101 3 year in Babylon. But now, when he heard that, hav-

he sent word to us that we should go without arms in groups 01
two hundred or three hundred to Jerusalem, and that, after adoring
the Lord, we should return. rBut we laughed at this, expecting
God’s mercy, and announced that unless he freely gave us Jerusa-
