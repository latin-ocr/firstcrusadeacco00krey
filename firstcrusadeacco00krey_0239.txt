THE FIRST CRUSADE 217

(Raymond.) On the day fixed they burned the city and set
forth. But the count, his clerics‚ and the Bishop of Albara
went unshod, invoking the compassion of God and the protection
of the saints. Tancred followed us with forty knights and many
foot—soldiers. XVhen the kings of that land heard this, they sent
Arab nobles with many entreaties and gifts to the Counts, (promis-
ing) now and thereafter to be their tributaries, and to bring provis-
ions free and for sale. After receiving security from them on oath,
as well as foods for the journey, we continued further. Moreover‚ we
had guides from the King of Caesarea who led us badly on the first
day, as it seemed to us, for in that camp we were in want of every
thing except water. Then on the second day these same guides im-
prudently led us into a certain valley where the cattle of the King
and the whole region had fled for fear of us. At that time the King,
having known long before that we would come there, had com-
manded all his Saracens to flee before us; but if he had commanded
that all of that region should oppose us, it would not have turned
out so well. Raymond of Lille and his companions caught a Sara-
cen this day with letters of the King, which he was bearing to all
of that region, (saying) to fiee before us. When this became known
to the King, he said, “I had ordered my men to fiee before the
Franks as fast as they could, and (instead) they came to them. Ι
see that God has chosen this people; besides, ‚whatever they do, Ι
will not harm them.” Then the King himself blessed God, who
provides sufficient necessaries for those who fear Him.

However‚ when our knights saw such sudden and so great abun-
dance, they and the sturdier people took up all their money and
went to Caesarea and Camela to buy fat horses there, saying‚ “Since
God has taken concern about our food, we will take care of His
poor and His army.’' Thus it came about that we had about a
thousand very fine chargers. The poor daily grew better; the
knights were daily comforted; the army seemed daily* to be multi-
plied‚ and the farther we proceeded the greater benefits God pro-

vided for us. Although everything was coming to us in sufficient '

quantities, yet some bent the Count to this plan, that he should
want to go off the route a bit for the sake of Gibellum, which is a
city on the sea— —c.oast But Tancred and many other brave men and
good» brought it about that this did not happen in any way, saying:

“God has visited the poor and oiirselves‚ and ought we to depart
from the journey? The past labors at Antioch, the misery of bat-
tle, coffi, hunger, and every kind of suffering are enough for us.
Why should we alone besiege the whole world, and kill all the in-
habitants of the world? Behold of one hundred thousand knights
