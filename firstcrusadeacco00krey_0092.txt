76 THE FIRST CRUSADE

for a distance of three miles, killing them even at the camp of
Peter. And going within the tents, they destroyed with the sword
whomever they found, the weak and the feeble, clerics, monks, old
women, nursing children, persons of every age. But they led away
young girls whose face and form was pleasing in their eyes, and
beardless youths of comely countenance. They carried off to Nicaea
money, garments‚ mules, horses‚ and all valuable things, as well
as the tents themselves.

But above the shore of the sea, near the aforesaid Civitote, was
an ancient, deserted fortress. Towards that fortress three thousand
pilgrims rushed in flight. They entered the ruined fortress in hope
of defense. But finding no gates or other obstacles, and anxious
and deprived of aid, they piled up their shields for a gate, along
with a huge pile of rocks; and with lances, wooden bows, and sling-

Nicaea, rioting most cruelly in every way. For they tore some of
the children apart, limb from limb and, piercing others through
