THE FIRST CRUSADE ⁴ 167

of adoption and promise‚' according to the apostle are the heirs of
Christ to whom He has already given the promised inheritance,
saying through the prophets, ‘From the rising to the setting of
the sun shall be your border and no one shall stand before you.’4
Who can contradict or oppose these words? Certainly, if you
undertake this battle against them, yours will be the very greatest
loss and disgrace, and you will lose many of your faithful knights
and all the spoils which you have with yon, and you will turn in
flight with exceeding fear. However, you shall not die now in this
battle, but, nevertheless, in this year, because God does not with

and so I arn exceedingly sad and fear greatly lest Ι remain bereft
of ou.’'

cymbam said to her: “Dearest mother, explain to me all the in-
credible things which are in my heart.’'

Answering this, she said: “This‚ dearest‚ I will do freely‚ if Ι
know the things which are unknown to you.”

He said to her: “Are not Bohemund and Tancred gods of the
Franks, and do they not free them from their enemies, and do not
