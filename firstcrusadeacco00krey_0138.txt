118 THE FIRST CRUSADE

were also there, who humbly besought God to destroy the power
of our enemy and shed upon us the gifts of his mercy. VVeeping,
they sang, and singing, they wept. Then many, fearing that death
was near, ran to the priests and confessed their sins to them. Our
leaders, Count Robert of Normandy, and Stephen, Count of Blois,
and Robert, Count of Flanders, and Bohemund, also, resisted the
enemy with all their might and often tried to charge upon them.
They, also, were strongly attacked by the Turks.

But the Lord, no doubt appeased by our supplications‚—for Hc
gives victory neither to the splendor of nobility nor to brilliance of
arms, but to the pure in heart and to him whose need is piously
fortified by divine strength,—little by little restored to us our
strength and weakened the Turks more and more. For we saw our
allies hastening to our aid from behind. Praising God, we regained
our courage and, forming into troops and cohorts, pressed forward
to resist them. Oh, how many of our men, coming slowly after us,
they killed that day! From the very first hour of the day until the
sixth, as I have said, difficulties checked us; but then, little by lit-

Divine Grace was with us, for, as if by sudden impulse, all the
Turks turned their backs on us in flight. But we followed thern
through the mountains and valleys, calling after them loudly. We
did not cease pursuing them until our advance guard had corne up
to their tents. There some of our men loaded horses and camels
with their goods and even with the tents which the Turks in their
fright had left there. Others followed the fleeing Turks even until
night. But because our horses were famished and tired, we kept
a few of theirs. It was a great misaele of God that, during the fol-
lowing day and the third, the pagans did not halt in their flight,
although no one, unless it were God, followed them further. Ex-
ceedingly rejoiced at such a victory, we all gave thanks to God be-
cause He did not will that our expedition should be annihilated,
but that it should prosper more gloriously than usual, for the honor
of His own Christianity. Wherefore‚ from the East to West its
glory shall resound forever.

(Gesta.) Then we went on pursuing the most iniquitous Turks,
who daily fied before us. But they went to all the fortified towns
or cities‚ deceiving and deluding the inhabitants of those lands‚
saying: “We have conquered all the Christians and have so over-
come them that no one of them will ever dare to arise before us;
