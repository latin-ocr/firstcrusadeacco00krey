THE FIRST CRUSADE 25

about like a raging lion seeking whom he may demur, stirred up
to the confusion of the people a certain rival to Urban, Wibert⁷ by
name. Incited by the stimulus of pride and supported by the shame-
lessness of the aforesaid Emperor of the Bavarians, wibert at-
tempted to usurp the papal office while Urban’s predecessor, Greg-
ory, that is Hildebrand, was the legitimate Pope: and he thus caused
Gregory himself to be cast out of St. Peter-'s So the better people
refused to recognize him because he acted thus perversely. After
the death of Hildebrand, Urban, lawfully elected, was consecrated
by the cardinal bishops, and the greater and holier part of the people
submitted in obedience to him. wibert, however, urged on by the
support of the aforesaid Emperor and by the instigation of the
Roman citizens, for some time kept Urban a stranger to the Church
of St. Peter; but Urban, although he was banished from the Church,
went about through the country, reconciling to God the people who
had gone somewhat astray. VVibert, however, puffed up by the
primacy of the Church, showed himself indulgent to sinners, and
exercising the office of pope, although unjustly, amongst his ad-
herents, he denounced as ridiculous the acts of Urban. But in the
year in which the Franks first passed through Rome on their way
to Jerusalem, Urban obtained the complete papal power every-
where, with the help of a certain most noble matron, Matilda8 by
name, who then had great influence in the Roman state. Wibert
was then in Germany. So there were two Popes; and many did
not know which to obey, or from which counsel should be taken, or
who should remedy the ills of Christianity. Some favored the one;
some the other. But it was clear to the intelligence of men that
Urban was the better, for he is righly considered better who con-
trols his passions, Just as if they were enemies. Wibert was Arch-
bishop of the city of Ravenna. He was very rich and revelled in
honor and wealth. It was a wonder that such riches did not satisfy
him. Ought he to be·considered by all an exemplar of right living
who, himself a lover of pomp, boldly assumes to usurp the sceptre
of Almighty God? Truly, this office must not be seized by force,
but accepted with fear and humility.

What wonder that the whole world was a prey to disturbance and
confusion? For when the Roman Church, which is the §oure-epos ·

- ,vcorrrection for all Christianity, is troubled bfa'ny‘dissorder, the sor-

row is communicated from the nerves of the head to the members
subject to it, and these suffer sympathetically. This Church, indeed,
our mother, as it were, at whose bosom we were nourished, by whose
doctrine we were instructed and strengthened, by whose counsel
we were admonished‚ was by this proud Wibert greatly afflicted.
