132 THE FIRST CRUSADE

through the midst of Armenia we routed the unspeakable Turks,
who had incessantly followed us, (and pursued them) up to the
great Euphrates river and even to the bank of this river, where
they dropped all their baggage and pack saddles and fled through
the river into Arabia. But the braver of these Turks, entering
Syria, hastened by forced marches night and day, in order that they
might enter the royal city of Antioch before our arrival. The whole
army of God, however, upon learning of this (victory), gave fitting
thanks and praise to the Omnipotent Lord.

(Simeon and Adlzemor.) Simeon, Patriarch of Jerusalem and
Adhemar,¹'³ Bishop of St. Mary of Puy, especially the latter, who
received from Pope Urban charge of the Christian army; greeting,
peace, and eterna] salvation from our God and Lord Jesus Christ.

By common advice we clergy, bishops, and monks, as well as
dukes, counts, and other leading laymen are sending (envoyss) to
you with most urgent prayers for the salvation of your souls. We
admonish all who dwell in the northern regions of the west not
to delay coming to us. However, let those corne above all who de-
sire their salvation and have bodily health and means for the
journey. Even though you can come with but little, God Almighty
will provide for you so that'you may live. We Christians‚ most
beloved brethren, are in Romania. Though with great difficulty,
we have, nevertheless‚ conquered the large city of Nicaea and sub-
jected it to our sway. We have fought three battles; our army has
moved from Nicaea to Antioch; and we have taken by storm many
other cities and fortresses of the Turks. we have a hundred
thousand mounted knights and armored men, but what of it? We
are few in comparison with the pagam, but verily God is fighting
in our behalf. In this connection, hear, t00, brethren, the miracle
which the same most holy Patriarch commends to all Christians—
how the Lord Himself appeared to him in a vision, promising that
each one now engaged in this expedition will march before Him
on that awful last day of Judgment wearing a crown. Therefooe,
since you well know that those who have remained apostate in
deed, after having been signed with the crOSS, are in truth excom-
municate, we admonish and beseech you to smite them all with the
sword of anathema, if they do not make haste to follow us, so that
by next Easter they may be where we are in Romania. Farewell.
Be mindful of us who are laboring night and day. Pray for us,

(Gesta.) Now grain and all food began to be excessively dear
before the birthday of the Lord. We did not dare to go outside;
