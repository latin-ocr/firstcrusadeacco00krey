110 THE FIRST CRUSADE

independent spirit, professed that he owed saith to Bohemund alone,
and would serve him even to death. Rebuked by the loud protest
of those of his own fellows who stood near, and of the Emperor's
retinue‚ besides, he turned toward the tent in which the Emperor
was then ‹lwelling—the largest and most capacious which anyone has
ever seen—and, as if to make sport of them, said, “If you give me
this (tent) full of money and, in addition, all the other presents
which you gave all the counts, I, t00, will take the oath.'' But
Palaeologus,²⁵ full of zeal for the Emperor, could not endure the
mocking speech of Tancred and pushed him away with contempt.
Then Tancred, very ready with his arms, sprang upon him. Seeing
this, the Emperor arose hastily from his seat and stood between
them. Bohemund, too, restrained the youth, saying “It is not fitting
shamefully to strike the kinsman of the Emperor.’' Then Tancred,
recognizing the disgrace of his insolence toward palaeologus, and
persuaded by the advice of Bohemund and the others, offered to
take the oath himself. . . .

10. The views of Alexim 071 his relations with the Crusaders.

How much you have written to my empire, most venerable ser-
vant of God, abbot of the monastery of Monte Cassino! Ι have
read your letter which declares honor and praise to my empire.
Toward me and my subjects there is, indeed, very great favor from
Almighty and Most Merciful God, for many are His blessings.
Through His compassion and by His grace He has honored and
exalted my empire. However, not only because I have nothing of
good within me, but because I sin above all men, I daily pray that
His compassion and patience may be sent to sustain my weakness.
But you, filled with goodness and virtue, judge me, sinner that Ι
3111, 3 good man, and truly you have the advantage of me. My
empire, though it is praised without having work worthy of praise‚
holds the praise to its own condemnation.

“I beseech you earnestly to furnish aid to the army of Franks‚'’
your most thoughtful letter state. Let your Venerable Holiness be
assured on that score, fofinssy empire has been spread over them and
will aid and advise them on all matters; indeed, it has already co-
operated with 1116111 according to its ability, not as a friend, or rela-
tive, but like a father. It has expended among them more than
anyone can enumerate. And had not my empire so cooperated with
thern and aided thern, who else would have afforded them help?
Nor does it grieve my empire to assist a second time. By God’s
grace, they are prospering up to this day in the service which they
have begun‚ and they will continue to prosper in the future as long
