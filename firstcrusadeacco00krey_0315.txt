NOTES 291

⁸Probably none of the writers were present on this journey of adven-
ture. The Anonymous undoubtedly obtained his account from the gossip
of Tancred’s men at Antioch‚ while Fulcher acquired his information from
Baldwin on the way to Edessa. Raoul de Caen, whose intimate acquaintance
with Tancred several years later renders his account of somewhat more
than secondary value, has more to say of this clash between Baldwin and
Tancred. The affair at Tarsus, as related by Raoul, is in substantial agree-
ment with the accounts of the Anonymous and Fulcher‚ but he adds that
Baldwin followed Tancred to Adana, where the latter was encamped within
the city walls. A quarrel arose over the price of supplies, and the two
leaders drew up their forces for battle outside the city. Tancred, with
fewer troops, refused to advance beyond the support of the hurling machines
on the walls, while Baldwin, under the circumstances, was unwilling to risk
his superior forces. An equal number of knights from each army advanced
to settle the dispute by wager of battle. The outcome was indecisive‚ an
equal number on each side being unhorsed. Finally, better counsel prevailed,
and peace was established between the two leaders. Raoul further says that
Baldwin was rescued by Tancred when he was surrounded by Turks at
Artasia. This seems improbable in view of Fulcher's statement that Bald-
win had returned to the army at Marasch and departed thence toward
Edessa. See Raoul de Caen: Gesta Tancredi, Chapters 33-47.

9This place is not to be confused with Rugia, from which it was a day’s
march.

1⁰ Mt. Mareyart, according to description, must have been the hill behind
Bohemund’s camp, although this is not entirely certain.

11 This title is not exact. Bohemund was Count of Otranto, but from
Anselm’s rather distant point of view Bohemund’s followers carne from a
region so close to Rome that they might well be called Romans.

12 These men, most of whom are not mentioned elsewhere, were probably
all from the northern part of France, and well known to both Anselm and
the readers of his letter.

13 See Introduction, p. 5.

14 Possibly a corruption of protospatharius, an official of the imperial
guard. The name as here written cannot be identified exactly in the Greek
of the period.

15 Assam, or Asam, was a Turkish lord of considerable power who took
a prominent part in later wars with the Eastern Empire. The policy of
leaving garrisons at various places along the line of march had an important
bearing upon the career of the army itself, for, while many of the garrisons
were too small to cover the territory assigned to thern, their absence did
weaken the strength of the main army.

1⁶ See Chapter Ι, note 27.

1⁷ The hill to the south of the city on which Tancred was stationed.

13 Raymond's use of this term is somewhat uncertain. Spain was so called,
of course, but it was clearly not the region here referred to. Ispahan, the
name of a town and a large portion of Persia, seems equally out of the
