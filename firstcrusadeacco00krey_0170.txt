148 THE FIRST CRUSADE

lt came to a light, and our men turned their backs. Indeed, we
lost up to three hundred men, but how much booty and how many
arms it is impossible to say. While we were being slaughtered and
pressed together like cattle among the mountains and precipices,
the men from the camp began to advance against the enemy. And
so it happened that they (the Saracens) were recalled from a slaugh-
ter of the fugitives. Why thus, Lord God? They in the camp
were beaten, and these two greatest princes in Thy army were also
beaten outside the camp! Should we fiee to the camp? Or those
from the camp to us? Arise and aid us, for Thy name’s sake!
Because if it had been learned back in the camp that the princes
were beaten, or if it had chanced that we knew of the flight of
those in the camp, all would have fled together. The Lord God
thus arose as our helper at the opportune time, and those whom He
had previously terrified‚ He now aroused to be first in battle.

Xthen Gracianusfs· ruler of the city, saw the spoils taken from
our men, and the victory of his people‚ and that some of the
men were still bold, he sent all his knights and t'oot-soldiers
out; and, led on by hope of victory, he ordered the gates of the
city to be shut behind his men, ordering his knights to conquer or

of the enemy. There was, indeed, such lamentation and outcry to
God in the camp that you would have thought the mercy of God
must descend at the flowing of their tears. When they were about
to come to close quarters, a certain knight, Ysoard of Ganges, a
most noble Provencal with one hundred and fifty foot-soldiers,
called upon God on bended knees. Then‚ encouraging his compan-
ions by saying, “On, soldiers of Christ 1⁵⁵ he rushed upon the enemy.
Our other lines attacked likewise. Thereupon‚ the arrogance of
the enemy is disturbed. The gate is shut, the bridge is narrow, but
the river is very wide. What result? The enemy in panic are
knocked down and killed and overwhelmed with stones in the river;
no avenue of escape, moreover, lies open. And had not Gracianus
opened the gate of the city, we would on that day have had peace
from Antioch. I have heard from many who were there that with
boards taken from the bridge they destroyed twenty Turks and
more in the river. The Duke of Lorraine gained much glory there,
for he checked the enemy at the bridge and divided them in two as
they were climbing up.

Thereupon‚ when the victory had been achieved, our men re-
