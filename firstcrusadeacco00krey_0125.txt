THE FIRST CRUSADE 107

Church of Rheims, my fathers and lords, to be mindful of us, not
only of me and these who are still sweating in the service of God,
but also of those of the army of the Lord who have fallen in arms,
or died in peace.

ί But these matters aside, let us return to our promise. Accord-
ingly, after our army arrived at Nicomedia and we were placed at
the gates of the land of the Turks, leaders, as well as followers,
cleansed by confession, fortified ourselves by partaking of the body

his company with the greatest respect, I separated from him as
from a father. He, however, commanded that ships be made ready
for me, by means of which Ι crossed very quickly the peaceful arm
of the sea which surrounds the city. „Some people are wont to say
that the arm of the sea at Constantinople is raging and periIOUS‚
which is false; for one need feel no more uncertainty at all on it
than on the Marne or Seine. Thence we came to that other Strait
which is called the Arm of St. George. Along this we ascended,
