214 THE FIRST CRUSADE

this account very many of our men turned back, despairing of the
j ourney without the help of the Frankish people. But the Saracens
and the Turks said on the contrary: “And who can resist these
people, who are so obstinate and cruel that for a whole year they
could not be turned from the siege of Antioch by famine, sword,
or any other dangers, and who now live on human flesh ?'' These
and other very cruel practices the pagans said existed among us.
For God gave fear of us to all people, but we did not know it.
The Count, meanwhile having returned to Marra from the collo-
quy, was exceedingly angry at the people about the destruction of
the wall. But when it was explained to him that neither the Bishop
nor other princes could move the people, either by threats or blows‚
from the destruction of the walls, he learned thereby that it was
divine and ordered the foundations of the wall to be destroyed.
Meanwhile, the famine grew daily more severe. And now when
the day proposed for the journey was at hand, we commanded the
people to offer to God alms and prayers for the journey. But
when the Count saw that none of the leading princes came to him,
and he perceived almost all his people wasting away, he commanded
the people to go into interior Hispania for food, and (he said that)
he himself with his knights would precede them. But this did not

are scarcely three hundred knights, and there is not a large number
of other armed men, and yet will some go on the expedition and
others stay here within the destroyed city, which is without forti-

the Count. ⁴
Nevertheless, in the end the Count set forth because of the poor
and gained many castles and captives and great spoil. When he
was returning with great exultation and victory after very many
of the Saracens had been killed, six or seven of our poor were cap-
tured and killed by the pagans. All these dead, however, had
crosses on their right shoulders. Moreover, when the Count and
those with him saw this, they thanked Almighty God, who was mind-
ful of His poor, as much as possible, and for this reason they were
greatly comforted. And thus that they might satisfy all who had·
remained with the baggage at Marra, they brought along one of the
killed who was still breathing. Verily‚ we beheld a miracle in that
man, who, though he scarcely had a whole place where his soul
could hide, lingered for seven or eight days without food, bearing

r witness that Jesus, to whose judgment he was to g0‚ without doubt,

was God the Author of this cross. Therefore, comforted by the
favorable turn of events and by the (sign of the) cross‚ they left
