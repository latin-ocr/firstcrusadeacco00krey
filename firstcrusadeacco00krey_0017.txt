INTRODUCTION

It is now more than eight hundred years since Christian Europe
was first aroused to arms in an effort to wrest the Holy Land from
the hands 01 1116 Infidel, and yet the interest in those expeditioris
still persists. Scarcely a generation has passed without demanding
a fuller and 11651161 account 01 1116 Crusades 101· 115 own perusal.
Sober historians have sought earnestly to answer the call, but,
voluminous as their work has been, the 1311611111 poet and novelist
have succeeded in keeping a pace in advance. It would require many
pages to list only the titles 01 1116 books and articles which the last
generation alone has produced. Apparently the subject will not
cease to appeal to the interest 01 1116 world so long as the history 01
Syria remains a treasured memory. And the story 01 1116 11151 and
most successful Christian effort to retake possession 01 1116 Holy
Land will continue to be read with feeling by the descendants, blood
and spiritual, 01 111056 first Crusaders. It seems, therefore, not
out 01 place 10 make available 101 1116 English reader the story 01

11131 expedition 35 related by the men who witnessed it and parti-
cipated in it.

I. GENERAL IMPORTANCE OF THE CHRoNICLEs

Modern writers have viewed the Crusades with varying opinion.
Scholarly enthusiasts have seen in them “the first great effort of
mediaeval 1116 10 go beyond the pursuit 01 56111511 31111 150131611 3111-
bitions; . . . the trial 1631 01 1116 young world essaying to use,
to the glory 01 God and the benefit 01 many, the arms 01 115 new
knighthood.''1 Others, like Gibbon‚ more cynical in their attitude,
have seen in thern only the mournful spectacle 01 hundreds 01
thousands 01 human beings led on to inevitable slaughter by 3 spirit
01 ignorant 1311311615111.2 However varied the opinion on the wisdom
and the expediency 01 1116 undertaking, there is less room for
difference in regard to the importance 01 1116 111ον61116111 35 3 phase
in the development 01 European civilization. The highly localized
1116 01 1116 eleventh century, in which the immediate horizon so 011611
served to limit men's vision 01 knowledge, was shaken 110111 end to
end. Not all who started on this expedition to the Holy Land ever
reached the other end 01 Europe, to be sure, but even these saw
101 1116 first time strange cities and men and returned home, if 1101
with glory‚ certainly with more experience than they had had before.
