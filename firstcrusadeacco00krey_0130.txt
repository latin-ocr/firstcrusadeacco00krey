CHAPTER IV

FROM NICAEA To ANTIOCH

(In the march across Asia Minor the Crusaders ior the first time en-
countered their real enemy, the Seljukian Turks. These had previously con-
tented themselves with an effort to slip into Nicaea, their capital, but the
odds were too great and the city was allowed to fall. Now, however, with
the Crusaders on the march, the superior knowledge of the country enjoyed
by the Turks and their swifter horses combined to offset the numerical
advantage of the Christians. For the Latins considerably outnumbered the
Turks, in spite of the fact that they were so far away from home in the
heart of the enemy’s territory. The explanation of this anomalous situa-
tion lies in the condition of the Turkish and Mohammedan realm. The
' Caliph of Bagdad had become spiritual head of the Mohammedans. The
Caliph of Egypt was head of the Ishmaelite section of the Mohammedans
and bitterly opposed to the Caliph of Bagdad. Their fighting ground was*
Syria. Sixty years before the First Crusade, a new vitality had been in-
jected into the Caliphate of Bagdad by the creation of the Seljuk Sultanate.
These Seljuks, who were the most advanced of the Turks, had but recently
taken on the Mohammedan faith. With all the zeal of neophytes, they de-
voted themselves zeal-ously to the spread of their religion. Under their
earlier Sultans, they had extended their domain across Western Asia to the
very gates of Constantinople. The second of their Sultans to rule Western
Asia, Alp Arslan, had won a brilliant victory over the Eastern Empire at
Manzikert in 1071, which opened Asia Minor to the Turks. Their ideas of
political organization, however, were as rudimentary as those of the peoples
of the West, and Asia Minor was given to a relative on the feudal basis
of personal loyalty and homage to the Sultan. The vast empire of the Sul-
tans soon became unmanageable. The third Sultan, Malik Shah, found his
vassals restless and had to suppress at least one revolt. Upon his death in
1092, quarrels arose among his sons which lasted for more than a genera-
tion. During this time, the numerous feudal vassals exercised practical in-
dependence. They not only participated in the wars between the rivals, but
often warred with one another. It was at this juncture that the Crusaders
came. The Turks were so embittered among themselves that they refused
to make common cause against the invaders, and, as a result, the Crusaders
were able to overcome one after another of their principalities. The first of
these, called the Sultanate of Rum (Romania), included practically all οἱ
Asia Minor. This had been given to Suliman by Alp Arslan and had been
extended by him to Nicaea, which he made his capital. This Suliman was
well known and feared by the Greeks. His son, Kilij Arslan Daud‚ whom
the Crusaders called Soliman, was ruling at the time of the Crusa'de (1092-
1106) and led the fighting in Asia Minor against the Christians. ⁴
