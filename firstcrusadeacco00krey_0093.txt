THE FIRsT CRUsADE 77

advanced in years they inflicted every kind of torture. When
those in the city saw this being done, they opened the gates and
went out against them. As a result, a fierce battle took place, in
which, since the Normans fought ferociously, the citizens were
hurled back into the fortress. The Normans, after gathering up all
the plunder, again returned to Helenopolis, There a quarrel arose
between themselves and the other pilgrims who had not gone off
with them, a thing which usually happens in :an affair of this kind,
envy inflaming the *wrath of those left behind, and a riotous fight
followed the quarrel. The fierce Normans again separated (from
the others) and captured Xeroyord on their way at the first attack.

When this was learned, the Sultan sent Elchanes against them
with a suitable number of troops. When he reached them, he re-
captured Xeroyord, killed some of the Normans with the sword, and
carried off the rest as captives, planning at the same time, also, an
attack upon those who had remained with Kuku-Peter. And he set
ambushes at opportune places into which, when they left for Nicaea,
they would unexpectedly fall and be killed. But knowing also of
the avarice of the Gauls‚ he had summoned two men of bold spirit
and ordered them to go to the camp of Kuku-Peter to announce
that the Normans had captured Nicaea and were now sacking it to
the utmost. This report‚ brought to the camp of Peter, excited all
violently3 for when the mention of plunder and riches was heard,
they straightway set out in tumult on the road which leads to
-Nicaea, forgetful of their military training and of observing dis-
cipline in going out to battle. For the Latins are not only most
fond -of riches‚ as we said above, but when they give themselves to
raiding any region for plunder, are also no longer obedient to
reason, or any other check. Accordingly, since they were neither
keeping order nor forming into lines, they fell into the ambush of
the Turks around Draco and were wretchedly cut to pieces. In-
deed, so great a multitude of Gauls and Normans were cut down
by the Ishmaelite sword that when the dead bodies of the killed,
which were lying all about in the place, were brought together,
they made a very great mound‚ or hill, or look-out place, lofty as a
mountain, and occupying a space very conspicuous for its width
and depth. So high did that mound of bones tower, that some
barbarians of the same race as the killed later used the bones of the
slain instead of stones in constructing a wall, thus making that
fortress a sort of sepulchre for them. It stands to this day, an
enclosure of walls built with mixed rocks and bones.

And thus, after all had been wiped out in the slaughter, Peter
returned with only a few to Helenopolis, The Turks, in their de-
