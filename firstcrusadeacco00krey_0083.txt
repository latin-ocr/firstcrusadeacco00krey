THE FIRST CRUSADE 67

would make all arrangements with the Count, both about themselves
and whatever else should be necessary for the Journey. They an-
nounced, furthermore, that a battle was imminent, and that without
the support of so great a man it would probably be unfavorable;
that the Count should therefore go ahead with a few men, so that
when his army should arrive, everything would have been arranged
with the Emperor, and there would be no delay for anyone. At
length, the Count was persuaded to go abead of his army, in this
instance, alone, leaving his guard behind him in the camp. And
thus he went unarmed to Constantinople.
