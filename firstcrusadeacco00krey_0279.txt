THE FIRST CRUSADE 255

each one turn from his evil ways. Then with bare feet march
around Jerusalem invoking God, and you must also fast. If you
do this and then make a' great attack on the city on the ninth (lay,
it will be captured. If you do not, all the evils that you have
suffered will be multiplied by the Lord ?' ’¹

When the priest had said this to William Hugo, the brother
01 1116 Β151100, 10 1115 10111, Count Ysoard, and to certain of the clergy,
they assembled the princes and the people and addressed them.
“Brothers, you know why we undertook this expedition, and what
we have suffered, and that we are acting negligently in that we are
not constructing the machines that are needed to capture the city.
Likewise, we are not 63161111 10 1660116116 1116 Lord to us, for we
offend Him in many ways and through our evil deeds have driven
Him from us. Now, if it seems right to you, let each one become
reconciled to his brother whom he has offended, and let brother
graciously forgive brother. After this, let us humble ourselves be-
fore God; let us march around Jerusalem in bare feet and, through
the patronage of the saints, invoke the mercy of the Lord, so that
AJmighty God, who 101 us, His servants, laid aside the form of His
Godhead, assumed the flesh, and humbly rode into the city on 311
355 10 suffer death on the Cross for our 51115, may 601116 10 our aid.
If we make this procession around the walls, for the honor and
glory 01 Η15 1131116, He will open the city to us and give us judgrnent
upon His 6116111165 31111 01115, who now with unjust possession con-
taminate the place 01 His suffering and burial‚ the enemy who seek
10 deny us the great blessing of the place 01 God’s humiliation and
our redemption.''

These words were pleasing to both princes and people‚ and it
was publicly commanded that on the next Friday the clergy should
lead the procession with crosses and relies of the saints, while the
knights and all able-bodied men, with trumpets, standards‚ and arms,
should follow them, barefooted. All this we did according 10 1116
commands of God and the princes. When we reached the spot on
the Mount of Olives whence the Lord had ascended into heaven
after the resurrection, the following exhortation was made to the
people: “Now that we are on the very spot from which the Lord
1113116 Η15 ascension and we can do nothing more to purify ourselves‚
'let each one 01 115 forgive his brother whom he has injured, that
the Lord may forgive us.'' What more? All were reconciled to
each other, and with generous offerings we besought the mercy of
God that He should notv now desert His people, whom He had led
so gloriously and miraculously to this goal. Thus the mercy 01
God was obtained, since every thing that had been against us was

now favorable.
