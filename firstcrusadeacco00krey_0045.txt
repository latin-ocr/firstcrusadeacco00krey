THE FIRST CRUSADE 29

the name of Christ—misery‚ poverty, nakedness, persecution, want,
illness, hunger, thirst, and other (ills) of this kind, just as the Lord
saith to His disciples: ‘Ye must suffer much in My name,’14 and
‘Be not ashamed to confess Me before the faces of men; verily Ι
will give you mouth and wisdom,'15 and finally, ‘Great is your re-
ward in Heaven’ ”¹⁶ And when this speech had already begun to
be noised abroad, little by little, through all the regions and coun-
tries of Gaul, the Franks, upon hearing such reports, forthwith
caused crosses to be sewed on their right shoulders‚ saying that they
followed with one accord the footsteps of Christ, by which they had
been redeemed from the hand of hell.

(Pulcher.) But the Pope added at once that another trouble, not
less, but still more grievous than that already spoken of, and even
the very worst, was besetting Christianity from another part of the
world. He said: “Since‚ O sons of God, you have promised the
Lord to maintain peace more earnestly than heretofore in your
midst‚ and faithfully to sustain the rights of Holy Church, there
still remains for you, who are newly aroused by this divine correc-
tion, 3 very necessary work, in which you can show the strength of
your good will by a certain further duty, God's concern and your
own. For you must hasten to carry aid to your brethren dwelling
in the East, who need your help, which they often have asked. For
the Turks‚ a Persian people, have attacked them, as many of you

Christians, they have 'already often conquered them in battle, have
killed and captured many, have destroyed the churches‚ and have
devastated the kingdom of God. If you allow them to continue
much longer, they will subjugate God’s faithful yet more widely.

“Wherefore, Ι exhort with earnest prayer—not I, but God—that,

as heralds of Christ, you urge men by frequent exhortation, men of ,

all ranks, knights as well as foot-soldiers, rich as well as poor, to
hasten to exterminate this vile race from the lands of your brethren‚
and to aid the Christians in time. I speak to those present; I pro-
claim it to the absent ; moreover, Christ commands it. And if those
who set out thither should lose their lives on the way by land, or in
crossing the sea, or in fighting the pagans, their sins shall be re-
mitted. This I grant to all who go, through the power vested in
me by God. Oh, what a disgrace, if a race so despised, base, and
the instrument of demons, should so overcome a people endowed
with saith in the all-powerful God, and resplendent with the name
of Christ! Oh, what reproaches will be charged against you by
