will return to you.’'' And when they enter battle, let them say
this ‘Our enemy are assembled and glory in their own bravery;
destroy their might, O Lord, and scatter them, so that they may
know that there is no other who will fight for us except Thee, O
Lord,’ And say this also to them ‘If ye do whatever Ι command
you, even for five days, Ι will have mercy upon you !' '’

Moreoven while He was saying this, a woman of countenance
radiant beyond measure approached and, gazing upon the Lord,
said to him, “Lord, what are thou saying to this man ?”

would have remained. Nevertheless, William of Grandmesnil ssed,
and his brother, and many others, cleric and lay. It befell many,
however, that when they had escaped from the city with the greatest
