THE FIRST CRUSADE 201

him conduct himself according to the above directions. If, how-
ever, they are unwilling to do this, let the Count with the children
of God punish 1116111.”

These words, at first believed, were then forgotten, for some said,
“Let us return the city to the Einperor.” Others, however, said not.

When, indeed, Peter was pressed by death at the siege of Archas,
he called the Count to him and said, “When you have reached
Jerusalem, have the army ask God 10 prolong your life and continue
it, and God will prolong it as much as you have already lived. How-
ever, when you shall have returned, place the Lance of God five
leagues from the church of St. Trophim, and 113116 3 611111611 1111111
there, and let there be a medal which you shall swear is not falsified,
and do not allow anything else to be falsified there. That place will
be called the Mount of Joy. Let these things be (lone within Pro-
vence, for St. Peter promised to his disciple‚ St. Trophim,4 that
he would send the Lance of God to 111111.”

01 1116 poor was wiped out. Of this advice which the princes re-

for the sake 01 1116 poor to lead them into Hispania for plunder.
He urged greatly that the Count, 101 God, for the glory 01 1116 racc
01 1116 Franks, and for himself, should aid the Turks who were call-
ing upon God, adding that the besieged Turks held forth the Cross
against the machines 01 1116 besieging Turks. After these and
many other prayers 01 11115 kind, the Count set out with the Duke.
However, when this was found out by the Turks, they withdrew
from the siege. As our army came to Asa, the Duke received hos-
tages from the 10111655 101 fealty thereafter, and the Count, with
a heavy expense 10 1115 army, returned 10 Α11110611. Again the Count
assembled his army 10 lead the poor people into Hispania because
they were failing from hunger and illness at Antioch.

However, St. Andrew appeared to Peter Bartholomew, this time
