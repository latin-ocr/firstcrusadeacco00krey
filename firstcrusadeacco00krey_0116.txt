98 THE FIRST CRUSADE

injuries; that there was nothing of which the Count could complain,
except that while the army of the Count in its usual manner was
devastating the villages and towns, it took to flight upon seeing his
(the Emperor's) army. Nevertheless‚ he promised that he would
give satisfaction to the Count and offered Bohemund as a hostage
for the satisfaction. They went to trial; the Count, according to
law, was compelled to give up his hostage.

Meanwhile, our army came to Constantinople; and after this the
Bishop, whom the army had left ill at Durazzo, followed us with
his brother. Alexius asked (homage) again and again and promised
that he would give much to the Count if he would do him the de-
sired homage as the other princes had done. The Count, however,
was constantly meditating how he might avenge the injury to his
men, and drive away from himself and his followers the disgrace
of such great infamy. But the Duke of Lorraine, the Count of
Flanders, and the other princes deprecated such action, saying that
it would be very foolish to fight with Christians when the Turks
were threatening. Bohemund‚ indeed, promised that he would aid
the Emperor, if the Count made any attempt against the Emperor,
or if he no longer refused homage and oath. Thereupon, the Count
took counsel with his men and swore that neither in person nor
through another would he sully the life or honor of Alexius And
when asked about homage, he replied that he would not do it at the
risk of his head, wherefore the Emperor gave him few gifts.

the city in a suburb‚ and his force had remained behind. Accord-

as the others had done. And while the Emperor was making these
demands, the Count was meditating how he might take vengeance
on the army of the Emperor. But Duke Godfrey and Robert‚ Count
of Flanders, and the other princes said to him that it would be un-
just to fight against Christians. The wise man, Bohemund, also said
that if the Count should do the Emperor any injustice, and should
refuse to do him fealty, he himself would take the part of the
Emperor. Accordingly, the Count, after receiving the advice of
his men, swore that he would not consent to have the life and
honor of Alexius sullied either by himself or by anyone else. When
he was called upon for homage, he answered that he would not do
this at the risk of his head.

Then the host of Lord Bohemund approached Constantinople.
Tancred, indeed, and Richard of Principati, and almost the whole
of Bohemund's force with them, crossed the Strait by stealth, to
avoid the oath to the Emperor. And now the army of the Count
