THE FIRsT CRUsADE 275

Dead because nothing living flourishes in it. This sea, which is
called Lake Asphaltites, is believed to be bottomless and to have
buried in its depths the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. Following
St. Jerome, whom Ι read in his exposition upon the prophet Amos,
I conjectured quite carefully with regard to these springs that
Dan was located in that part of Judea where Paneas now is; for the
tribe of Dan built there a city which they called by the name of their
father, Dan. For this reason, Ι think the one spring was called
Dan, and the other Jor which was adjacent to it. Then we came to
a very strong city which they called Balbec, built by Solonion, and
surrounded by high walls, and called by him Thadamar.²⁶ This is
situated a two days march from upper Syria, about six days journey
from great Babylon, and about one day’s march from the Euphrates,
The Greeks called this place Palmyra. Here springs and wells
abound3 but water was never found in the lower land.

Then about four hundred soldiers of the Turks of Damascus
came out to meet us. Because they thought we were unarmed and
greatly exhausted from our labors, they supposed that we were
also discouraged. If Lord Baldwin had not on that day cautiously
and carefully guarded the rear, perhaps they would have killed
many of us. For our bows and arrows were spoiled in a rainstorm‚
since in that region they were fastened together with glue. Bohe-
mund was leading the first division of our army. So, with the help
of God, the pagans got no advantage of us. Then we camped before
that town. On the very next day approaching nearer to the sea,
we passed over the the cities of Tortosa and Laodicaea. There at
Laodicaea we found Count Raymoml, whom we had left there.
Because food was scarce‚ we could buy no supplies on which we
could live. Therefore we hastened, without stopping, until we ar-

rived at Edessa. . . .
