THE FIRST *CRUSADE 55

vowed, and arrived in a great multitude at the city of MainZ. There
Count Emico, a nobleman, a very mighty man in this region, was
awaiting, with a large band of Teutons, the arrival of the pilgrims
who were coming thither from diverse lands by the King’ s highway.

The Jews of this city, knowing of the slaughter of their breth-
ren, and that they themselves could not escape the hands of so
many, fled in hope of safety to Bishop Rothard. They put an in·
finite treasure in his guard and trust, having much saith in his pro-
tection, because he was Bishop of the city. Then that excellent
Bishop of the city cautiously set aside the incredible amount of
money received from them. He placed the Jews in the very spa-
cious ¹hall of his own house, away from the sight of Count Emico
and his followers, that they might remain safe and sound in a very
secure and strong place.

But Emico and the rest of his band held a council and, after
sunrise, attacked the Jews in the hall with arrows and lances.
Breaking the bolts and doors‚ they killed the Jews, about seven hun-
dred in number, who in vain resisted the force and attack of so
many thousands. They killed the women, also, and with their
swords pierced tender children of whatever age and seX. The
Jews, seeing that their Christian enemies were attacking them and
their children, and that they were sparing no age, likewise fell upon
one another, brother, children, wives, and sisters, and thus they
perished at each other's hands. Horrible to say, mothers cut the
throats of nursing children with knives and stabbed others, prefer-
ring thern to perish thus by their own hands rather than to be killed
by the weapons of the uncircumcised.

From this cruel slaughter of the Jews a few escaped; and a few
because of sear, rather than because of love of the Christian saith,
were baptized. With very great spoils taken from these people,
Count Emico, Clarebold, Thomas, and all that intolerable company
of men and women then continued on their way to Jerusalem, di-
recting their course towards the Kingdom of Hungary, where pas-
sage along the royal highway was usually not denied the pilgrims.
But on arriving at Wieselburgy, the fortress of the King‚ which the
rivers Danube and Leytha protect with marshes, the bridge and
gate of the fortress were found closed by command of the King
of Hungary, for great sear had entered all the Hungarians because
of the slaughter which had happened to their brethren. .

But while almost everything had turned out favorably for the
Christians‚ and while they had penetrated the walls with great
openings‚ by some chance or misfortune, Ι know not what, such
great sear entered the whole army that they turned in flight, just
