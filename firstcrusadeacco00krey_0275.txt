THE FIRST CRUSADF. 251

where he had first pitched his tent, with the exception of a few
who accompanied the Count. However, by great rewards the Count
daily induced knights and footmen to guard his camp. There are
in that church these sacred treasures—the tombs of the kings, David
and Solomon, as well as that of the first martyr. St. Stephen. There
the Blessed Mary departed from this world; the Lord supped
there and, after rising from the dead, appeared there to His dis-
ciples and to Thomas. On this spot, also, the disciples were filled
with the Holy Spirit.

Thereupon, when the siege had been set, it happened one day
that some of the leaders of the army met a hermit on the Mount of
Ohves, who said to them, “If you will attack the city tomorrow till
the ninth hour, the Lord will deliver it into your hands.” They
replied, “But we do not have the necessary machinery for storm-
ing the walls.'’ The hermit replied: ‘'God is all powerful. If He
wills, He will storm the walls even with one ladder. The Lord aids
those who labor for the Truth.'' So, with such machinery as could
be constructed during the night, an attack was made on the city
in the early morning, and it lasted till the third hour. The Saracens
were compelled to retreat behind the inner walls, for the outer
wall was broken down by our men, some of whom even climbed
to the top of the inner walls. Now when the city was about to be
captured, in the confusion of desire and fear the attack was in-
terrupted‚ and we then lost many men. On the next day no attack

was attempted.
After this, the whole army scattered throughout the surrouuding

country to collect provisions, and nothing was even said of the .

necessity of preparing the machines that were needed to capture
the city. Each man was serving his mouth and stomach; what
was worse, they did not even ask the Lord to free them from such
great and manifold evils, and they were afflicted even unto death.
Just before our arrival, the Saracens had filled up the springs,
destroyed the cisterns, and dammed up the brooks from the springs.
And the Lord Himself had turned rivers into wilderness and water-
springs into thirsty ground for the wickedness of them that dwell
therein.⁹ Therefore water was obtained with great difficulty.
There is a fountain at the foot of Mount Zion, which is called the
Pool of Siloam. Indeed, it is a large spring, but the water flows
forth only once in three days, and the natives say that formerly it
emptied itself only on Saturdays; the rest of the week it remained
stagnant. We do not know how tolexplain this, except that the
Lord willed it to be so. But when, as we have said, the water did
flow forth on the third day, it was consumed with such great
