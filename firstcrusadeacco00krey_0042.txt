26 THE FIRST CRUSADE

For when the head is thus struck. the members at once are sick.
If the head be sick, the other members suffer. Since the head was
thus sick, pain was engendered in the enfeebled members3 for in
all parts of Europe peace, goodness, saith, were boldly trampled un-
der foot, within the church and without, by the high, as well as by
the low. It was necessary both that an end be put to these evils,
and that, in accordance with the plan suggested by Pope Urban‚
they turn against the pagans the strength formerly used in prose-
cuting battles among themselves. . .

He saur, moreover‚ the faith of Christendom greatly degraded by
all, by the clergy as well as by the laity, and peace totally disre-
garded; for the princes of the land were incessantly engaged in
armed strife‚ now these, now those quarrelling among themselves.
He saw the goods of the land stolen from the owners; and many,
who were unjustly taken captive and most barbarously cast into
foul prisons, he saw ransomed sor excessive sums, or tormented
there by the three evils, starvation, thirst, and cold, or allowed to
perish by unseen death. He also saw holy places violated‚ monas-
teries and villas destroyed by fire‚ and not a little human suffering,
both the divine and the human being held in derision.
³ WVhen he heard, too, that interior parts of Romania were held

pity; and, prompted by the love of God, he crossed the Alps and
came into Gaul. He there called a council at Clermont in Auvergne.
which council had been fittingly· proclaimed by envoys in all direc-

and abbots who bore the crozier. When they were assembled on the
day appointed for the council, Urban‚ in an eloquent address full of
sweetness, made known the object of the meeting. With the plain-
tive voice of the afflicted Church he bewailed in a long discourse
the great disturbances which, as has been mentioned above, agitated

the world where saith had been undermined. Then, as a supplicant, ’

he exhorted all to resume the fullness of their saith, and in good
earnest to try diligently to withstand the deceits of the devil‚ and
to raise to its pristine honor the status of Holy Church, now most
unmercifully crippled by the wicked.

“Dearest brethren‚'' he said, “I, Urban‚ invested by the permission
of God with the papal tiara, and spiritual ruler over the whole world‚‘
have come here in this great crisis to you, servants of God, as a
messenger of divine admonition. I wish those whom I have be-
lieved good and faithful dispensers ot' the ministry of God to be
found free from shameful dissimulation. For if there be in you
