THE FIRST CRUSADE 35

phen‚ the first martyr! How happy, O, John the Baptist‚ the waters
of the Jordan which served you in baptizing the Saviour! The chil-
dren of Israel, who were led out of Egypt, and who prefigured you
in the crossing of the Red Sea, have taken that land by their arms,
with Jesus as leader; they have driven out the Jebusites24 and other
inhabitants and have themselves inhabited earthly Jerusalem, the
image of celestial Jerusalem.

“What are we saying? Listen and learn! You, girt about with
the badge of knighthood‚ are arrogant with great pride: you rage
against your brothers and cut each other in pieces. This is not
the (true) soldiery of Christ which rends asunder the sheep-sold of
the Redeemer. The Holy Church has reserved a soldiery for her-
self to help her people, but you debase her wickedly to her hurt. Let
us confess the truth, whose heralds we ought to be; truly, you are
not holding to the way which leads to life. Yon, the oppressers of
children, plunderers of widows3 you, guilty of homicide, of sacri-
lege, robbers of another’s rights; you who await the pay of thieves
for the shedding of Christian blood—as vultures smell fetid corpses,
so do you sense battles from afar and rush to them eagerly. Verily,
this is the worst way, for it is utterly removed from God! If,
forsooth, you wish to be mindful of your souls, either lay down the
girdle of such knighthood‚ or advance boldly, as knights of Christ,
and rush as quickly as you can to the defence of the Eastern
Church. For she it is from whom the joys of your whole salvation
have'come forth, who poured into your mouths the milk of divine
wisdom‚ who set before you the holy teachings of the Gospels. We
say this, brethren, that you may restrain your murderous hands
from the destruction of your brothers, and in behalf of your rela-
tives in the saith oppose yourselves to the Gentiles. Under Jesus
Christ, our Leader, may you struggle t‘or your Jerusalem, in Chris-
tian battle—line, most invincible line, even more successfully than
did the sons of Jacob of old—struggle, that you may assail and
drive out the Turks, more execrable than the Jebusites, who are in
this land, and may you deem it a beautiful thing to die for Christ
in that city in which He died for us. But if it befall you
to die this side of it, be sure that to have died on the way is of
equal value, if Christ shall find you in His army. God pays with
the same shssling, whether at the first or eleventh hour. You
should shudder, brethren, you should shudder at raising a violent
hand against Christians; it is less wicked to brandish your sword
against Saracens. It is the only warfare that is righteous‚ for it is
charity to risk your life for your brothers. That you may not be
troubled about the concerns of to-morrow, know that those who
