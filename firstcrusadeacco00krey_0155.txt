THE FIRST CRUSADE 133

we could find absolutely nothing to eat within the land of the
Christians, and no one dared to enter the land of the Saracens with-
out a great army. At last holding a council, our seignors decided
how they might care for so many people. They concluded in the
council that one part of our force should go out diligently to col-
lect food and to guard the army everywhere, while the other part
should remain faithfully to watch the enemy. At length, Bohemund
said, “Seignors, and most distinguished knights, if you wish, and it
seems honorable and good to you, Ι will be the one to go out with
the Count of Flanders on this quest.'' Accordingly, when the ser-
vices of the Nativity had been most gloriously celebrated on Mon-
day, the second day of the week‚ they and more than twenty
thousand knights and footmen went forth and entered the land of
the Saracens, safe and unharmed.

There were assembled, indeed, many Turks, Arabs, and Saracens
from Jerusalem, Damascus, Aleppo, and other regions, who were

But others, who had remained alive, fied swiftly and went away
to the wrath of perdition. We, however, returning with great re-
joicing, praised and magnified God, Three in One, who liveth and
reigneth now and forever, Amen.

Finally, the Turks in the city of Antioch‚ enemies of God and
Holy Christianity, hearing that Lord Bohemund and the Count of
Flanders were not in the siege, came out from the city and boldly
advanced to do battle with us. Knowing that those most valiant·
knights were away, they lay in ambush for us everywhere, more es-
pecially on that side where the siege was lagging. One wednesday
they found that they could resist and hurt us. The most iniquitous
barbarians came out cautiously and, rushing violently upon us,
killed many of our knights and foot-soldiers who were off their
guard. Even the Bishop of Puy on that bitter day lost his sene-
schal, who was carrying and managing his standard. And had it
