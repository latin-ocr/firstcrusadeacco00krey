THE FIRST CRUSADE 153

quickly (as possible) to Bohemund, saying, “Why do you stand
here, illustrious man? Why have you come hither? Behold, we
already hold three towersl’' Bohenmnd was moved with the
rest, and all went joyfully to the ladder. Accordingly, when those
who were in the towers saw this, they began to shout with happy
voices, “God wills it!’' We began to shout likewise; now the men
began to climb up there in wondrous fashion. Then they reached
the top and ran in haste to the other towers. Those whom they
found there they straightway sentenced to death; they even killed a
brother of Pirus. Meantime the ladder by which we had ascended
broke by chance, whereupon there arose the greatest dismay and
gloom among us. However, though the ladder had been broken,
there was still a certain gate near us which had been shut on the
left side and had remained unknown to some of the people, for it
was night. But by feeling about and inquiring we found it, and
all ran to it; and, having broken it open, we entered through it.

Thereupon, the noise of a countless multitude resounded
through all the city. Bohemund did not give his men any rest,
but ordered his standard to be carried up in front of the castle
on a certain hill. Indeed, all were shouting in the city together.
Moreover, when at earliest dawn those in the tents outside heard
the most violent outcry sounding through the city, they rushed out
hurriedly and saw the standard of Bohemund up on the mount, and
with rapid pace all ran hastily and entered the city. They killed
the Turks and Saracens whom they found there, except those
who had fied into the citadel. Others of the Turks went out through
the gates, and by fleeing escaped alive.

But Cassianus, their lord, fearing the race of the Franks greatly,
took flight with the many others who were with him and carne
in flight to the land of Tancred, not far from the city. Their
horses, however, were worn out, and, taking refuge in a certain
villa, they dashed into a house. The inhabitants of the mountain,
Syri‘ans and Armenians, upon recognizing him (Cassianus),
straightway seized him, cut off his head, and took it into the
presence of Bohemund, so that they might gain their liberty. They
also sold his sword—belt and scabbard for sixty besants. All this
occurred on the third day of the incoming nionth of June, the fifth
day of the week, the third day before the Nones of June. All the
squares of the city were already everywhere full of the corpses of
the dead, so that no one could endure it there for the excessive
stench. No one could go along a street of the city except over the

bodies of the dead.
