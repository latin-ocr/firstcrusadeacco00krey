THE FIRST CRUSADE 155

escape death. A certain incident occurred there, joyful and delight-
ful enough for us. For when some Turks strove to flee among the
cliffs which divide the hill in two from the north, they encountered
some of our men, and when the Turks were forced to go back, the
repulsed fugitives went with such rapidity that they all fell over
the precipice together. Our joy over the fallen enemy was great, but
we grieved over the more than thirty horses who had their necks
broken there.

How great were the spoils captured in Antioch it is impossible
for us to say, except that you may believe as much as you wish and
then add to it. Moreover, we cannot say how many Turks and
Saracens then perished3 it is, furthermore‚ cruel to explain by what
diverse and various deaths they died. &When those foes who guarded
the castle on the middle hill saw the destruction of their men and
that our men were refraining from besieging them, they kept their
castle. Gracionus, however, who had gone out by a certain postem,
was captured and beheaded by some Armenian peasants, and his
head was brought to us. This, I believe, was done by the ineffable
disposition of God, that he who had caused many men of this same
race to be beheaded should be deprived of his head by them. The
city of Antioch was captured on the third day before the Nones of
June; it had been besieged, however, since about the eleventh day

(stophen). Hastening to the aforesaid city of Antioch with
great joy, we placed it in siege and there we very often had many
conflicts with the Turks. Seven times, in truth, we fought with the ξ
inhabitants of Antioch, and with innumerable allies advancing to
their aid, whom we chanced to meet. We fought them with fiercer
spirits, Christ leading, and in all the seven aforesaid battles‚ the
Lord God cooperating, we were victorious; and most truly we
killed numbers of them beyond all count. But in these same battles‚
and in very many attacks made against the city, they killed many
of our brothers who worship Christ, whose souls have truly gone
to the Joys of Paradise.

Moreover, we found Antioch a city great beyond belief, very
strong and unassailable. And too, more than five thousand bold
Turkish knights had collected within the city, not to mention the
Saracens, Publicani, Arabs, Turcopoles, Syrians, Armenians, and
i* w* peoples, of whom an infinite multitude had come
