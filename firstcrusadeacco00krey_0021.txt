THE FIRST CRUSADE 5

the people who went on the expedition did so with the expectation
of returning home after the fulfillment of their purpose. As a re-
sult, the social interests of the local communities were suddenly ex-
panded even to Palestine itself. Since, moreover, there were few
regions of western Europe which did not furnish some of their
people for the cause, many different lines of interest focused them-
selves upon the army and were constantly crossing one another.
Secular Europe was no longer limited by a local horizon; it was
ever eager for news, and more news, from the East. Neighborhood
gossip could serve only as a local distributing agency in this work.
&Vayfarers were eagerly accosted for news and probably supplied
the localities with much real information. But where the interest
was great and so constant, the temptation to expand small items
to magnificent proportions was too great to be resisted, and many a
glib-tongued impostor exchanged the fabrication of his fertile im-
agination for full fare and comfortable lodging. Some of these
wild tales found their way into writing ancl were transmitted to
a credulous posterity with all the authority which the written page
could lend. Authentic information—and even the common world
was soon forced to discriminate between kinds—had to be obtained
through more assured channels. The service of couriers‚ long
known to the official world, was expanded to meet the need.

ΠΙ. LETTERS

In the earlier stages of the march it was a relatively easy matter
to detach squires or foot-soldiers and send them back with messages
and news. This continued even to the time when the army left
Nicaea; thereafter this method became impracticable‚ if not quite
impossible. Chance meetings with ships from the West then
offered almost the only opportunity to exchange greetings, and, as
the accounts show, these opportunities occurred but rarely. Letters
alone could be used under such circumstances. It was, therefore,
fortunate that the expedition represented a union of ecclesiastical
and secular interests, for the churchmen, priests, or clerics lent
themselves willingly to the task of drawing up letters—in Latin, of
course. The churchmen in the West, upon receiving these letters,
copied them and rapidly passed von the information to the waiting
world. Such letters, even when addressed to individuals‚ were re-
garded as common property, unless they were carefully sealed, and
their contents were widely diffused, usually at Church gatherings of
some sort. How eagerly the congregations everywhere must have
looked forward to such meetings for news from relatives, friends,
and acquaintances, gone so long and so far away!
