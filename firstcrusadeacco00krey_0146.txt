the city. Indeed, they craftily investigated our condition and
strength and reported everything to those excommunicate who were
shut up in the city. But after the Turks had been informed of
our condition, they began little by little to go out from the city
and to harass our pilgrims, not only on one side, but on all sides,
for they were in hiding everywhere, from sea to mountain, to
meet us.

Moreover, there was at no great distance a certain fortress named
Aregh, where many very brave TurkS, who frequently disturbed
our men, were gathered. Thereupon, when our seignors heard such
reports, they were exceedingly sorry, and sent some of the
knights to explore carefully the place where the Turks were. when
they had found the place where they were concealed, our
knights, who were seeking them, encountered them. But while our
men were retiring little by little to the place where they knew Bohe-

speak about Antioch and its location so that the battles and
assaults which were made there may be easily understood by
those who have not seen it. There is a certain plain among the
mountains of Lebanon which in width is one day's travel, and in
length a day and a half. This plain has on its western side a cer-
tain swamp; on the east, a river which, after encircling a certain
part of this plain, so winds back to the foot of the mountains which
are in the middle of that land that there is no passage between the
mountains and the stream, and thus it flows into the Mediterranean,
which is very close to Antioch. Moreover, Antioch is so situated
in those passes which the river, clinging to the aforesaid mountains,
