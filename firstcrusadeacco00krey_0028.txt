12 THE FIRST CRUSADE

Crusaders of 1096, enlisted in the army which Bohemund 35-
sembled 111 1107. He reached Syria and entered the service of
Tancred, then prince of Antioch‚ whom he served until the latter's
death. 111 his early years he had received instruction in letters from
Arnulf, who became Patriarch of Jerusalem after 1112. He was
an accomplished knight and seems to have enjoyed the friendship
of Tancred. During the 11151 five years of this relationship he
learned much about the First Crusade, especially Tancred's view
of events. He also visited Jerusalem and there conversed with
his former teacher, Arnulf, now the Patriarch, to whom he dedicated
his work, the Gesta Tancredi. Though an important source of in-
formation, this‘work is not, strictly speaking, an eye-witness account.
It is a panegyric of the Norman princes of Antioch and is very hostile
to the Emperor Alexius and to Count Rayniond. It deals with the
history of the First Crusade and of Tancred up to 1105, and its
chief value lies in the refle'ction of the Norman point of view. It
also contains some information not afforded by other writers. The
Latin is polished and adorned with numerous passages and quota-
tions from Classical authors. Raoul writes chiefly in prose, hut he
sometimes attempts to soar to poetic form in describing unusually
great achievements. On the whole, Patriarch Arnulf had reason
to be proud of his former pupil's achievement. The book was
written sometime between Tancred's death in 1112 and that 01

01 Brussels. His account 01 1116 Holy Lance, in which he takes
an opposite view from Raymond‚ is here translated in full. Other
material from the work is included in the notes.

The value of the account by &HQ 01 Aix has been much dis-
puted. Little is known of 1116 author, who is said to have been a
canon 01 1116 church 01 Aix-la—Chapelle about the middle 01 1116
twelfth century. By his own confession he never visited the Holy
Land himself. Nevertheless‚ he wrote a history of the First Crusade
and the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem down to the year 1120, of
which twelve MS copies exist. The date of this writing has, there-
fore, been placed somewhere between 1120 and the middle of the
century. He obtained his information, he says, from the oral and
written testimony of participants. Much of the material is palpably
legendary; more of it, however, seems entirely probable and stands
the test of comparison with well established accounts. The work
contains so much not treated by other writers and, therefore, in-
capable 01 corroboration that its value must stand or fall with the
reader’s attitude toward the author. It has been conjectured that
