58 THE FIRST CRUSADE

Wieselbm‘gy in the Kingdom of Hungary—after all these things, the
very noble Godfrey, Duke of Lorraine‚ and his brother Baldwin,
VVerner of Grez, a kinsman of the Duke, and Baldwin of Burg,
likewise a kinsman, Reinard, Count of Toul, and Peter his brother,
Dodo of Coum, Henry of Ascha, and his brother, Godfrey, set out,¹⁷
in the same year, in the middle of the month of August. While
making a journey in direct march to Jerusalem. they halted in their
course near Tollenbury in the realm of Austria, where the Leytha
terminates the kingdom of Gaul ¹⁸ and separates it from the Austrian
realm. They remained there three weeks in the month of Septem-
ber, to hear and to understand why sedition had arisen; why the
army had perished a few days before; why those whom they met
returning in despair had been turned from their purpose of going
to Jerusalem with their chiefs and leaders.

Finally, after hearing very many evil rumors, they discussed what
should first be done to investigate the cruel attack which the Hun-

The King struck a treaty with Duke Godirey‚ and all the chiefs

who were to pass that way. When, therefore, these agreements had
been confirmed on both sides, the King, upon the advice of his men.
demanded as hostages‚ Baldwin, the brother of the Duke, his wife
and family. This the Duke agreed to fulfil without dispute. After
eight days, the embassy was dismissed, and the Duke ordered the
army to hasten to the fortress Oedenburg, and to pitch their tents
on the banks of the river near the marshes. . . . Finally, Baldwin‚
having put aside all doubt, consented to become a hostage and to
be taken into exile for the safety of his brethren.

And thus, when so distinguished a leader had become a hostage,
and when the King had returned with him to Pannonia, the entire
army, by order and permission of the King, was led over the bridge
across the marsh, and camp was pitched near the river Leytha. Then,
after camp was pitched, and after all were settled at rest, Duke
Godfrey appointed heralds to announce to each house and tent that,
