ΜΟ THE FIRsT CRUSADE

the north that it seemed as if dawn had arisen to announce the
day. :Xnd though in this way God chastised His army, so that we
were intent upon the light which was rising in the darkness, yet
the minds of some were so blind and abandoned that they were
recalled neither from luxury nor robbery. At this time the Bishop
prescribed a fast of three days and urged prayers and alms, to-
gether with a procession, upon the people; moreover, he commanded
the priests to devote themselves to masses and prayers‚ the clerics to
psalms. Thereupon, the merciful Lord, remembering His compas-
sion, put off the punishment of His children, lest the arrogance of
their adversaries increase.7

There was, besides, in our army a certain member of the Em-
peror's household whom he had given to us in his place, Tatius
by name, mangled in nose and all virtue. I had almost forgotten
him, since he deserved to be abandoned to oblivion forever. This
man, however, was daily whispering in the ears of the princes that
they should scatter to the neighboring camp, and thence assail the
people of Antioch by frequent assaults and ambush. However, as
all this was made clear to the Count (for he had been sick since
the day when he was forced to fiee at the bridge)‚ he called his
princes and the Bishop of Puy together. After holding a council,
he gave them fifty marks of silver on this condition, truly, that if
any of his knights lost a horse, it should be restored to him out of
those fifty marks and other (resources) which had been given to
the brotherhood. Moreover‚ this kind of cooperation was of great
profit at that time, since the poor of our army, who wanted to cross
the river to gather herbs, feared the frequent assaults of the enemy,
and since very rarely did any care to go against the enemy, because
their horses were starved and weak, and, in addition, so few that
scarcely one hundred could be found in the whole army of the
Count and Bishop. A similar lot had befallen Bohemund and the
other princes. Accordingly, for this reason our knights were not
afraid to meet the enemy, especially those who had bad or weak
horses‚ since they knew that if they lost their horses they would
obtain better ones Moreover‚ something else occurred, namely that
all the princes except the Count promised the city to Bohemund, pro-
vided it was taken. So Bohemund and the other princes swore to
this agreement, that they would not withdraw from the siege of
Antioch for seven yearS, unless the city was taken.

While these matters were happening in the camp, rumor also
announced that the army of the Emperor was coming. It was re-
ported to have been assembled from many peoples; namely, Slavs
and Patzinaks and Cumans and Turcopoles. For they are called
