THE FIRST CRUSADE 205

and the Patriarch holds under his sway one hundred and fifty-three
bishops.⁹ The city is enclosed by two walls; the greater one, fur-
thermore, is very high and marvelously wide, and constructed of
great stones‚ on which have been arranged four hundred and fifty
towers. The city is beautiful in every way. On the east it is en-
closed by four mountains‚ on the west beside the walls fiows a cer-
tain stream, Orontes by name. So they were unwilling foolishly or
senselessly to give up the regal city of Antioch, which was of such
great authority that it held seventy-five kings under its sway. The
chief of these was King Antiochus,10 from whom it is called Anti-
och. The Franks besieged that city for eight months and a day,
and afterwards were shut up in it for three weeks by the Turks
and other pagans, than whose number there has never been a greater
gathering of men, whether Christians or Pagans. Nevertheless,
after those people had been defeated by God’s Christians, with the
aid of God and the Holy Sepulchre, we rested in Antioch with great
joy and gladness for five months and eight days.

When these things had been fulfilled, Raymond‚ Count of St.
Gisses, left Antioch with his army in the month of November and
came to a city called Rugia and to another which is called Basra.
But at the end of the fourth day of outgoing November he came
to the city of Marra, in which a very great multitude of Saracens,
Turks, Arabs, and other pagans had been assembled, and the Count
himself attacked it on the next day. Not much later, Bohemund
with his army followed the Countsll and joined them on the day
of the Lord.

On the second day of the week they attacked the city vigorously
on all sides, so fiercely and so powerfully that their ladders were set
up against the wall. But so very great was the valor of the pagans
that on that day they could do them no hurt or offense. How-
ever, when our leaders saw that they could accomplish nothing and
were laboring in vain, Raymond‚ Count of St. Gisses, caused a
certain wooden fortress to be made strong and high. This fortress
was contrived and built on four wheels. On (the top of) it were
stationed many knights and Everard the Hunter, who sounded his
trumpet loudly, but below were armed knights who took the fort-
ress up to the very wall of the city, near a certain tower. When
the pagan people saw this, they immediately constructed a machine
by means of which to cast great stones on the fortress, so that they
almost killed our knights. They also threw Greek fire on the fort-
ress, expecting it to burn and be destroyed. But Almighty God was
unwilling to burn the fortress in this fashion, for it towered over
all the walls of the city. Accordingly, our knights who were in the
