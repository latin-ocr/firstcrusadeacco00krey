CHAPTER VI

DISSENsroN AMONG THE LEADERS

(With the overthrow of Kerbogha all pressing danger from the Seljukian
Turks and the Caliph of Bagdad was ended for several years at least,
Henceforth the most serious obstacle from the Mohammedan side consisted
in the Fatimite Caliph of Egypt. The latter, however, had entered into
negotiations with the Crusaders, so that there was little cause to worry οη
that score. All Syria was now at the disposal of the Christians‚ and the fear
of immediate danger was removed. But this situation threatened even greater
perils to the cause of the Crusaders. For the main incentive for close co-
operation and harmony was lost with the removal of danger from common
foes. The death of Adhemar, papal vicar, at this juncture aggravated the
state of affairs, for it took away the only leader who had claims upon the
allegiance of them all. As a result, the leaders quarrelled and all but fought
with each other. On one pretext and another the journey to Jerusalem was
postponed to satisfy their selfish ambitions. The amazing pressure exerted
at length by the common knights and foot-soldiers for some unity of action
and adhesion to the original vow deserves much >greater attention in the
history of feudal organization than has usually been accorded it. Count
Raymond's use of Peter Bartholomew to support his personal plans was
undoubtedly the chief cause for questioning the Lance, on which Peter’s
reputation was primarily based. Mediaeval history affords few instances of
the trial by the ordeal of fire so stringent or so graphically described, and
the varied account of the outcome betrays what intense feeling had sprung
up among the parties since the capture of Antioch. The elaborate version
by Raymond, in marked contrast with the absolute silence of the Anonymous,
necessitates the addition of the less direct testimony of Raoul de Caen and
Fulcher. The question continued a subject of debate for years in the West,
as well as in the East, but for the time being the Ordeal made united action
again possible.)
