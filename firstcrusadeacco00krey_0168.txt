146 THE FIRST CRUSADE

their horscs and many other things which were necessary enough
ior us.

(m the next (lay, at earliest dawn, other Turks went out from
the city, and, collecting all the fetid corpses of the dead Turks
which they could find on the bank of the river, except those which
lay hitlden in the sand of the same river, they buried them at the
mosque which is across the bridge in front of the city gate. At
the same time they buried with them their garments‚ gold besants‚
bows, arrows, and very many other instruments which we were
unable to name. And so, when our men heard that the Turks had
buried their dead, all made preparation and came in haste to the
diabolical temple and ordered the bodies to be exhumed, the tombs
broken open, and the corpses dragged forth from the sepulchre.
They cast all the cadavers into a ditch and carried off the severed
heads to our tents, in order to find out their number exactly—all
the heads, that is, except those loaded upon the four horses of the
envoys of the Emir of Babylon and sent to the sea. The Turks
grieved exceedingly upon beholding this, and were sad even to

now reduced to nothing. We, however, roamed in security hither
and thither, to the Port and to the mountains‚ praising and glorify-
ing our Lord God, whose honor and glory is forever and ever,
Amen.

 

³ Now nearly all the roads were forbidden and closed to the Turks
on every side„ except on that part of the river where there was a
fort and a certain monastery. If this fortress had been thoroughly
guarded by us, not one of these people would have dared to go out
of the gate of the city. At length our leaders held a council and
with unanimous accord said, “Let us select one of us to hold that·
fort sturdily and close to our enemies the mountains and plains, the
entrance and exit of the city.’' But most of them refused to be
installed there themselves, unless there were many in a body
(with them). Tancred was the first to offer himself before
the others, saying: “If Ι knew what it would profit me, Ι would
carefully strengthen the fort with my men alone, and I would
energetically deny our enemy the road by which too frequently they
are wont to rage against us.’' They straightway promised him four
hundred marks of silver. Tancred did not tarry; although alone,
he went forth with his most renowned knights and servants and
