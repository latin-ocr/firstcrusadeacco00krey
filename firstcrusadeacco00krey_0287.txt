THE FIRST CRUSADE 263

therefore, the good men having been taken off, the clergy conducted
themselves humbly, all except the Bishop of Albara and some others.
However‚ the Bishop of Martirano,15 advancing by other than the
right road, since he had obtained the church of Bethlehem by fraud,
was captured by the Saracens on the third or fourth day and never
again appeared among us. The princes, disregarding admonition
and opposition, urged the Count of St. Gilles to accept the kingdom.
But he said that he abhorred the name of king in that city, though
he would consent to have others accept it. For this reason they
together chose the Duke and placed him in charge of the Sepulchre
of the Lord.

After this, however, the Duke required the Tower of David
from the Count. But the latter refused, saying that he wished to
stay in that region until Easter, and meanwhile he wanted to keep
himself and his men in honorable state. But the Duke said that
he would give up other places rather than the Tower. And so the

himself and often secretly charged the friends of the Count with
this affair.

So when the Tower had been surrendered, the Count blazed forth
into great anger against his people‚ saying that he could not remain
disgraced in that country. Accordingly, we set out from Jerusalem
to Jericho, took palms and went to the Jordan.¹⁶ There, as Peter
Bartholomew had commanded, a raft was constructed from twigs,
and with the Count on it we pulled it across the river3 since, forsooth,
we had no ship‚ this plan seemed better to us. When after this the
multitude had been called together, we commanded that they pray
God for the life of the Count and the other princes. Therefore
we proceeded to dress only in a shirt and new breeches, as we had
been commanded about baptism; but why the man of God so com-
