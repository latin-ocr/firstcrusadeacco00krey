THE FIRST CRUSADE 189

When all our figlting men had left the city, five other lines
appeared among us. For, as has already been said, our princes had
drawn up only eight, and we were thirteen lines outside the city. In
the beginning of the march out to battle the Lord sent down upon
all His army a divine shower, little but full of blessing. All those
touched by this were filled with all grace and fortitude and, despising
the enemy, rode forth as if always nourished on the delicacies of
kings. This miracle also affected our horses no less. For whose
horse failed until the fight was over, even though it had
tasted nothing except the bark or leaves of trees for eight days?
God so multiplied our army that we, who before seemed fewer
than the enemy, were in the battle more numerous than they. And
when our men had thus advanced and formed in line, the enemy
turned in flight without giving us a chance to engage in battle. Our
men pursued them until sunset. There the Lord worked mar-
velously as well in the horses as in the men; forsooth, the men were
not called away from battle by avarice‚ and those pack horses which
their masters had led into battle, after a scant feeding, now very
easily followed the sleekest and swiftest horses of the Turks.

But the Lord did not wish us to have this joy only. For the
Turks who were guarding the citadel of the city gave up hope upon
seeing the headlong fiight of their people; some, on the pledge of
their lives alone, surrendered themselves to us, and the rest fied
headlong. And though this battle was so terrible and frightful, yet
few knights of the enemy fell there ; but of their foot-soldiers scarcely
any escaped. Moreover, all the tents of the enemy were captured,
much gold and silver‚ and the greatest amount of spoils—grain and
cattle and camels without measure or number. And that incident
of Samaria1⁰ about the measures of wheat and barley which were
bought for a shekel was renewed for us. Moreover, these events
occurred on the vigils of St. Peter and Paul, through which inter-
cessors was granted this victory to the pilgrim church of the Franks
by the Lord Jesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth God through all
ages. Amen.

(Anselm.) But on the following day Corbara approached with
the King of Damascus, Duke Baldach,11 the King of Jerusalem, and
very many others and laid siege to the city. Accordingly, we were
both besieged by them, and (were ourselves) besieging the afore-
, said few in the castle of the city, and we were thus driven to eat
the flesh of horses and asses. Moreover, on the second day after
their arrival they killed Roger of Bameville.¹² On the third day,
