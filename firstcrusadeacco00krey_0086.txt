70 THE FIRST CRUSADE

shipment of troops to Syria by water did occur in the Crusade of 1101,
which Anna may very easily have confused with earlier events. Her ac-
count of Bohemund and of Raymond‚ also, is colored by her knowledge of
later events. but the versions given by the Anonymous, Raymond, and the
others serve to establish the actual occurrences fairly well. For the arrival
and treatment of Robert -of Normandy and Stephen of Blois at Constanti-
nople Fulcher's statements and those in Stephen's letter furnish ample cvi-
dence. The siege and capture of Nicaea is the most fully attested event in
the history of the First Crusade. Certain minor incidents in the siege, how-
ever, are related by only one or two of the writers who were in the imme-
diate vicinity. and the connection of the various chroniclers with one band
or the other must be borne in mind. Throughout the whole chapter the
contrast of western and eastern civilization‚ as evidenced by the frequent
naive expressions of wonder and amazement, on the one hand, and blase
contempt and horror, on the other, forms an interesting background to the

progress of events,)

rested from his labors when he heard rumors of the arrival of in-
numerable Fiankish armies. He ²-feared the incursions of these
people, for he had already experienced the savage fury of their
attack, their fickleness of mind, and their readiness to approach
anything with violence. . . .

And finally, he kept ever in mind this information, which was
often repeated and most true—that they were known to be always·
immoderately covetous of anything they strove after and to break
very easily for any reason whatsoever, treaties which they had
made. Accordingly, he did not indulge 1n any rest, but made ready
his forces 1n every way, so that when occcasion should demand he
would be ready for battle [For it was a matter greater and more

terrible than famine whi'lTwas then reported. Forsooth‚ the whole

West, and as much of the land of barbarian peoples as lies beyond
the Adriatic Sea up to the Pillars of Hercules—all this, changing
its seat, was bursting forth into Asia in a solid mass, with all its
belongings, taking its march through the intervening portion of
Europe.

A certain Gaul, Peter by name, surnamed Kuku-Peter‚³ had set
out from his horne to· adore the Holy Sepulchre. After suffering
many dangers and wrongs from the Turks and Saracens, who were
devastating all Asia, he returned to his own country most sorrow-
fully. He could not bear to see himself thus cut off from his pro-
posed pilgrimage and intended to undertake the expedition a sec—
ond time. . . .
