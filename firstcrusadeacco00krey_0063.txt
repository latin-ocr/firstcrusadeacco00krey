THE FIRsT CRUSADE 47

is three years old.

While by these and like signs all creation was being summoned
into the army ot' the Lord, that enemy of men, the evil one him-
self (ever on the watch, even while others are sleeping) did not
delay to sow his own tareS, to ronse false prophets, and, under the
guise of religion, to mingle with the army of the Lord false breth-

falsehoods of some and the gross immorality of others, the army
of Christ was polluted to such an extent that, according to the
prophecy of the good shepherd, even the elect were led astray. At

ᾖ who were poor in substance but abundant 1n numbers, attached them-

χ selves to a certain Peter the Hermit⁵ who appeared as a master while

² we were as yet still considering the project.

l He was from the city of Amiens, if I am not mistaken, and we
learned that he had lived as a hermit in the garb of a monk some-
where in Northern Gaul, I know not where. We beheld him leav-

He was very generousv to the poor from the wealth that had
been given him. He reclaimed prostitutes and provided them with
