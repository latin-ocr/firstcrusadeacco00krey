34 THE FIRST CRUSADE

human and divine? Of the Lord’s Sepulchre we have refrained
from speaking, since some of you with your own eyes have seen to
what abominations it has been given over. The Turks violently
took from it the offerings which you brought there for 311115 111 511611
vast amounts, and, in addition, they scoffed much and often at your
religion. And yet in that place (I say only what you already know)
rested the Lord; there He died for us; there He was buried. How
precious would be the longed—for, incomparable place of the Lord's
burial, even if God failed there to perform the yearly 111113616122
For in the days of His Passion all the lights in the Sepulchre and
round about in the church, which have been extinguished, are re-
lighted by divine command. XVhose heart is so stony, brethren,
that it is not touched by 50 great a miracle? Believe me, that man
is bestial and senseless whose heart such divinely manifest grace
does not move to saith! And yet the Gentiles see this in common
with the Christians and are not turned from their ways! They
are, indeed, afraid, but they are not converted to the faith; nor is it
to be wondered at, for a blindness of mind rules over them. With
what afflictions they wronged you who have returned and are now
plesent‚ you yourselves know too well, you who there sacrificed
your substance and your blood for God.

“This, beloved brethren, we shall say, that we may have you as
witness of our words. More suffering of our brethren and de-
vastation of churches remains than we can speak of one by one, for
we are oppressed by 16315 31111 groans, sighs and sobs. We weep and
wail, brethren, alas, like the Psalmist, in our inmost heart! We
are wretched and unhappy, and in us is that prophecy fulfilled:
‘God, the nation's 316 601116 11110 1111116 11111611131166; thy holy temple
have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem in heaps; the dead
bodies of thy servants have been given to be food for the birds of
the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.
Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem, and
there was none to bury 1116111.’23 Woe unto us, brethren! We who
have already become a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing, and
1161151011 10 1116111 round about us, let us at least with 16315 condole
and have compassion upon our brothers! We who are become the
scorn of all peoples, and worse than all, let us bewail the most
monstrous devastation of the Holy Land! This land we have de—
servedly called holy in which there is not even a foot-step that the
body or spirit of the Saviour did not render glorious and blessed;
which embraced the holy presence of the mother of God, and the
meetings of the apostles, and drank up the blood of the martyrs
shed there. How blessed are the stones which crowned you, Ste-
