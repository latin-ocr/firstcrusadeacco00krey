THE FIRsT CRUSADE 157

on that very day we went out along the road to receive our brothers
with joy, knowing nothing of their misfortune.

But while we were approaching the aforesaid gate of the
city, a horde of knights and foot-soldiers from Antioch, bearing
themselves in a triumphant manner, rushed likewise against us.
Upon seeing them, we sent word to the Christian camp that all
should follow us ready for battle. While our men were still
assembling, the separated princes—namely Bohemund and Ray-
mond, with the remainder of their army—came up and recounted
the great misfortune which had befallen them. At this very bad
news, 'our men, inl-lamed with anger against the sacrilegious Turks.
and ready to die for Christ, went into battle for the loss of their
brothers. However, the enemy of God and of ourselves fied before
us in haste and tried to enter their city, but by the grace of God
the affair turned out far otherwise. For when they wanted to cross
over the river by the bridge which ended at a mosque, we, following
them closely, killed many of them before they reached the bridge;
many we hurled off into the river, all of whom were killed; more-
over, we killed many on the bridge and likewise very many before
the entrance to the city. Verily I tell you, my beloved‚ and you
may believe most truly, that in that same battle we killed thirty
emirs‚ that is, princes, :and three hundred other noble Turkish
knights, not to mention the other Turks and pagans. Indeed, the
dead Turks and Saracens are reckoned 1230 in number! Of our

men, however, we lost not one single man. ι

⁷ Moreover, on the day following Easter, while my chaplain,
Alexander, was writing this letter with the greatest haste, a portion
of our men who were lying in wait for the Turks had a victorious
battle with them, the Lord leading, and they killed sixty of their
knights, whose heads they brought back to the army.

These things which Ι am writing to you, dearest‚ are indeed few
of the many (that have happened), and since Ι cannot express to you
all that my heart holds, dearest, Ι (only) bid you do well and make
excellent arrangement for your land, and treat your children and
your vassals with honor, as befits you, for you will surely see.
me as soon as Ι can possibly corne. Farewell.

(Anselm). In the name of the Lord!

To his lord and father, Manasses, by grace of God venerable
'Archbishop of Rheims, Anselm of Ribemont, his loyal vassal and

humble servant; greeting.
Let your Eminence, reverend father and lord, know that, even

though absent and not present, we are daily asking aid in our hearts
