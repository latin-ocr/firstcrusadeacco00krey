THE FiRsT CRUSADE 65

the Slavonians pressed upon him the more violently, and the Count
was compelled to follow the army, he ordered the eyes of some ot‘
them (the prisoners) to be torn out, the feet of others cut off, and
the nose and hands of still others to be slashed, so that while the
pursuers were thus moved at the sight and preoccupied with their
sorrow, the Count could safely escape with his companions. And
thus, by the grace of God he was delivered from the straits ot'
death and this difficult situation.

Indeed, what courage and wisdom the Count displayed in this
region is not easy to relate! For we were in Slavonia for almost
forty days, during which time we encountered clouds so dense that
we could feel them and push them before us with a slight movement.
Amidst all this, the ‘Count was fighting constantly at the rear and
ever defending his people. He was never the first, but always the
last, to encamp, and though the others went to rest at midday, or
at evening, the Count often did so at midnight, or at cockcrow. At
length, through the compassion of God, the labor of the Count, and
the advice of the Bishop, the army so crossed (Slavonia) that we
lost no one there from hunger, and no one in open battle. On that
account, Ι bear witness, God wanted his army to cross Slavonia‚
in order that the boorish men who did not know God, upon recog-

thing of their wildness or be brought without excuse to God’s
judgment. And then, after many labors, we came to the king of the
Slavonians at Scutari. The Count swore friendship with him and
gave him a large tribute, so that the army might buy or seek nec—
essaries in security. But this was a (vain) expectation, for we did

· penance enough for the peace we had sought when thereafter the

Slavonians, raging in their usual manner, killed our men and took
from the unarmed what they could. We sought not vengeance, but
a place of refuge. So much about Slavonia.

We came to Durazzo. We believed we were in our own country,
thinking that the Emperor and his satellites were our brothers and
helpmates. They, indeed, raging in the manner of lions, attacked
a peaceful people who thought of nothing less than arms. They
butchered them in secret places; they stole what they could by
night, in the woods, and in villages remote from the camp. Al-
though they raged thus, their leader promised peace. But during
the intervals of peace, they killed Pontius Reinald and mortally
wounded his brother, Peter, and these were most noble princes.
However, when an opportunity was presented to us for revenge,
we chose to continue the journey‚ not to avenge our wrongs. On
the way, we had letters from the Emperor about peace, brotherhood,
