NOTES 295

justed themselves to the changed conditions involved in the Crusade. In
this improvised election of Peter as Bishop of Albara there appear all the
elements so common in the VVest—the influence ot the Count, the nomina-
tion by the clergy‚ and the approval of the people. The great influence of
the secular Count is especially noteworthy in view of the fact that the papal
party to which he leaned was at that time engaged in the Investiture Strug-
gle, an effort to free the Church elections from this very influence.

⁸Raymond‘s insistence upon the Emperor's rights is all the more remark-
able in view of the fact that he was the only one of the leaders who never
took the prescribed oath to Alexius.

⁹This statement must be regarded as an exaggeration of the true condi-
tion. “Three hundred and sixty monasteries” might approximate the truth,
if by the term “monastery” is meant every building occupied by a monk or
monks. As for bishoprics, William, Archbishop of Tyre, counted no more
than twenty provinces in the patriarchate of Antioch.

10 Antiochus, after whom Antioch was named, was the son and successor
of Seleucus, the general of Alexander the Great. Seleucus built the city
and made it his capital. At this point in his version Tudebode lists the
names of the seventy kings over whom Antiochus is said to have ruled, but
as they are chiefly fanciful they have not been inserted.

11Robert of Flanders‚ according to Raymond (p. 209), and Robert of
Normandy, according to Raoul (chapter 96, Gesta Tancredi), had accom-
panied Count Raymond to Marra.

12 Tudebode at this point inserts the following: “There, with many others
who happily returned their souls to G0d‚ for whom they had assembled there,
a certain very excellent knight, Arnaldus Tudebodus, was killed.” . . . See
Tud. XII, 3.

1³ This doubtless has reference to the oath which they took to the Emp-
eror at Constantinople. That the Emperor regarded Antioch as within the
terms of the oath is indicated by his later struggles with Bohemund.

14 Venetians and Greeks had co-operated for centuries. In many respects
Venice may be regarded as one of the western trading posts of the Greeks.
The presence of the Venetian ships does not signify Venetian participation
in the Crusade, but rather the Emperor’s contribution to the support of the
army. The Venetian expedition of the year 1100 must be looked upon as the
first crusading expedition of the Republic.

15A1i, Mohammed’s son-in-law, whom the Fatimite Caliphs regarded as
Mohammed’s successor. This constituted one of the essential points of dis-
agreement with the Abassid Caliphs of Bagdad.

1⁸Arnu1f‚ who became one of the most powerful clerical leaders in the
army, was a native of Flanders. He is said to have been the son of a priest,
which, on strict canonical grounds, would have disqualified him for the
priesthood. However, large portions of Europe were still unconverted to
