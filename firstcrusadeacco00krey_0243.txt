THE FIRST CRUSADE 221

belief or probability, may God apply to me all the tortures of hell,
and erase me from the book of life! For though I am ignorant of
many things, this one I know: that since I have been promoted to
the priesthood on God’s expedition, I ought to obey God in wit-
nessing the truth, rather than to weave lies, striving for reward or
money from anyone else. But since, according to the apostle,
“charity vaunteth not itself,’' I want to proceed with the same char-
ity. May God give me aid!

While we were delaying somewhat in pressing this siege, our
ships came to us from Antioch and Laodicaea, also many other ships
of the Venetians14 and Greeks with grain, wine, and barley, pork,
and other things for sale. But since this castle was about a mile
from the sea, the ships could not remain in port, and the sailors re-
turned to the port of Laodicaea and to the port of Tortosa. This
Tortosa, a very strongly fortified place, built with walls and fore-
walls, and filled with many good things, had been abandoned by
its Saracen inhabitants for sear of our army alone. For God had

what they had begun came to naught. There Anselm of Ribemont
gloriously departed. When he arose in the morning, he called the
priests to him, and, having confessed his negligences and his sins,
he begged mercy from God and from them, announcing to them
that the end of his life was imminent. They were amazed at this,
since they beheld him well and unhurt, and he said to them:

“Do not wonder, but rather listen. This night I saw Lord Engel-
rand of St. Paul, who was killed at Marra. I was not asleep, but
awake, and Ι said to him, ‘What is this? For thou hast suffered

death and, lo! thou art now alivel'
“And he answered, ‘Indeed those who end their lives in the ser-

vice οἱ Christ do not die.’

“When I asked him again about his beauty, which was very great,
whence it had happened to him, he answered me, ‘Thou shouldst
not wonder about my beau-ty, when I dwell in so splendid a home.’

“And straightway he showed me his horne in heaven, so beauti-
