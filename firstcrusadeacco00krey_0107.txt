THE FIRST CRUSADE 89

there, were sent ahead to wound the Gauls at close quarters. Now,
when the two lines were a slight distance apart‚ they were then to
order those bowmen who had spearmen at their side to use their
bows carefully, aiming at the horses of the enemy, sparing the
riders; and it was further ordered that the spearmen should charge
with loose reins upon the Latins and with the full weight of their
horses. He gave that order with this in mind, that when their
horses were wounded, the violence of the Gallie attack would lan-
guish and the Romans would not easily be pursued by the knights;
and this, also, which he especially desired, that as little Christian
blood as possible should be shed. These men with ready courage
did what they had been commanded by the Emperor, and, after the
gates had been suddenly opened, they rushed against the enemy,
now giving free rein to their horses, now checking them. Thus they
killed many of the enemy; a few of our men were wounded in this
affair that day. . . . At length the Emperor sent in his own forces
and scattered and routed the legions of the Latins.

On the next day, Hugh set out to meet Godt‘rey and counselled
him to make peace with the Emperor, it' he did not want to try the
warlike' skill of the latter anew, to his own hurt, but especially to
pledge that he would keep inviolate his saith to the Emperor. God-

forces and wealth, now debased yourself from highest dignity to
the condition and lot of a humble client? And then, as if this were
some great and distinguished deed, you have corne to urge me, too,

we ought not to have departed from our own lands‚ and we ought
to have stayed away from those of others; but after we have come
hither to this place, where we may have necessities by the benevo—
lent care and providence of him who rules here, our business will
not turn out happily unless we accede to his counsels and demands.’'

When Hugh had returned, the matter only made worse, the Emp-
eror, informed through other sources that the rest of the counts who
were following Godfrey at a distance were already near, sent -chosen
leaders with their forces to the army of Godfrey with orders to
persuade him, but, if necessary, to compe] him to cross the Strait.
When the Latins saw them coming, without delay or even question
of what was wanted, they sprang up immediately to blows and bat-
tle. There occurred a most bitter conflict between them, in which
many on both sides fell. Those of our men who rushed too boldly
into the fray were wounded, but, as the Romans were conducting
themselves valiantly‚ the Latins turned their backs. And thus, at
