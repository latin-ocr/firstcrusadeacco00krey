THE FIRST CRUSADE 3

whether petty 01Î‡ great, trivial or important, was thought worthy of
commemoration for the benefit of posterity. Under the circum-
stances, the varied composition of the crusading host was par-
ticularly fortunate. Practically the only classes of Europe not
personally represented on the Crusade were Emperor and King,
Pope and Archbishop. In other words, that portion of society
which alone was deemed worthy of attention in the ordinary brief
annals and chronicles of the time was absent, and those who de-
tailed the story of the expedition lavished their enthusiasm upon
ordinary nobles, knights, and foot soldiers, even the poor being
accorded a generous measure of notice. These accounts, accord-
ingly, present a picture of society in which the relationship of all
classes, ecclesiastical and lay, masculine and feminine, is portrayed
in its intimate aspects. Although ordinary affairs are at times
slighted, the extraordinary recur so frequently and with such variety
as to make the inference of the ordinary fairly easy. The descrip-
tions are so full and touch so many activities of society that they
illumine not only the civilization of the time, but also cast con-
siderable light on the preceding and following periods. As a re-
sult, it has been a common practice for master historians to initiate
their apprentices into the study of European history through the
accounts of the First Crusade.

The literary value of these writings is rather indirect than other-
wise. They have afforded apparently inexhaustible material for
literature, but as literary productions themselves have been only
lightly appraised. Nevertheless, they are fair specimens of the
writings of that time, and, as such, they deserve some consideration
in a comprehensive history of literature. Some of them, such as the
letters of Stephen of Blois and Anselm of Ribemont, have a charm
which entitles them to much higher consideration. Here and there
in the chronicles the authors soar to fairly great heights. It would
be difficult to find anywhere a more graphic description of deep
despair than is presented by the anonymous author of the Gesta
in his account of the reception by Alexius and his army of the fate
of the Crusaders at Antioch. In like manner, the fanciful account
of the interview of Kerbogha and his mother before Antioch may
be ranked with many a better known piece of imagery. In general,
however, the literary merit of the following accounts consists chiefly
in their vivid realism, which the very crudeness of expression only
serves to accentuate. The hopes and fears, mournful sorrows and
exultant joys, the profound despair and terror of the army, as it
marched through one trial after another, are described with the
awful earnestness and sincerity of rnen who have actually shared
