64 THE FIRST CRUSADE

mund. Delighted, he received thern ; and with gladness he permitted
them to depart. Next we came to a certain town, which is called
Serrhae, where we fixed our tents and had a market sufficient foi·
that time. There the learned Bohemund made a very cordial agree-
ment with two Corrpaliatii,· and out of regard for their friendship,
as well as in justice to the land, he ordered all the stolen animals
which our men had to be returned. The Corpalatius promised him
that he would despatch messengers to return the animals to their
owners in order. Then we proceeded from castle to castle and
from villa to villa to the city of Rusa. The people of the Greeks
came out, <bringing us the greatest market, and went joyfully to
meet Lord Bohemund. There we pitched our tents in the fourth day
of the week >before the feast of the Lord.

however, will go on in advance.’' And he took with him a few
knights. Tancred remained at the head of the army of Christ, and,

suffered many losses on the way, especially because it was then
winter. For Slavonia was such a desert and so pathless and
mountainous that we saw in it neither wild animals, nor birds
for three weeks. The inhabitants of the region were so boorish and
rude that they were unwilling to trade with us, or to furnish us
guidance‚ but instead fied from their villages and their castles. In-
deed, they even butchered like cattle, or, as if they had done much
harm, the feeble aged and the weak poor, who, because of their
weakness, followed our army at a distance. Nor was it easy amidst
steep mountains and thick woods for our armed knights to pursue
the unarmed brigands who were acquainted with the country. But
they suffered them constantly, unable either to fight or to keep from
fighting. Let us not pass over a certain illustrious act of the Count.
When the Count with some of his knights had been hedged about
for some little time by the Slavonians‚ he made a charge upon them
and captured as many as six of them. And When, on this account,
