270 THE FIRST CRUSADE

the other armed men, as we said, were advancing in nine squadrons.
There were three on the rear, three in front, and three in the
middle, so arranged that from whatever side battle came, it would
be met in those three ranks, the middle squadron remaining as
a support of all. When the Arab herdsmen, however, saw the
knights who had been sent ahead, they (leserted their animals.
And yet, if God were regarding them as He regarded us, they should
have entered upon a fight with all of us. There were about three
thousand herdsmen in armS, but to our army we hesitatingly ascribe
more than twelve hundred knights, while we dare not put the
number of footmen beyond nine thousand. And so when the herds-
men had fied, we took as much plunder as we saw on that day.
Some of the herdsmen were killed and a few captured. After this,
however, we remained in the same place because it was evening.
And then we forced the captives to confess the intentions of the
enemy, their condition and number. They confessed, therefore,
that it was the will of these people to besiege Jerusalem, take the
Franks by storm, kill and capture them, and they added that the
Emir was in camp, five leagues away, ready to set forth against us
on the next day. Of their number, however, scarcely anyone was
certain, since they were being multiplied daily. When questioned
about themselves and their companions, they said they were herders
of animals which were to be distributed for a price among the
forces of Babylonians.

Accordingly, our men, eager and assured of battle, sent back to
their companions the causes of trouble and controversy. After
this, they confessed their sins and negligence and were so cheered
in spirit that it seemed scarcely credible to thern that the enemy
were prepared for battle. For such security grew up in the hearts
of each man that they believed their enemy more timid than hinds,
and more harmless than sheep. But we had this security because
we believed that God was with us, as in the other matter, and that
because of the blasphemy made against Him He would deal (with
them) on His own account, even if our cause were valueless. There-
fore we regarded Him as our Defender, and ourselves as aids to Him
in His (struggle). Then it was proclaimed through the army that
all should be ready for battle in the morning, and that each one
should attach himself to the princes of his people, and that no one
should touch plunder‚ and that any who touched it before the battle
was finished would be excommunicated. We spent that night poorly
enough, for we had no tents; a few had bread, no one wine, and
very few grain and salt, but meat was as abundant as sand. We ate
meat, and for bread we had the soft flesh of sheep.
