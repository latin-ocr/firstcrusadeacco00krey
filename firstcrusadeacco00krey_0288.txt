264 THE FIRsT CRUSADE

manded‚ we still do not know. When these matters had been accom-
plished‚ we returned to Jerusalem.

At this time, Arnulf, chaplain of the Count of Normandy‚ was
chosen Patriarch by some, the good (clergy) opposing it not only
because he was not a subdeacon‚ but especially because he was of
priestly birth and was accused of incontinence on our expedition,
so much so that they shamelessly composed vulgar songs about him.
But, led on by such ambition, and disregarding the decrees of the
canons and the infamy of his birth and conscience, he stirred up
the people against the good (clergy) and had himself raised upon
the patriarchal seat with hymns and chants and the great applause
of the people. The divine vengeance exacted from the Bishop of
Martirano, who had been the instigator and executor of this affair,
not only did not terrify Arnulf, but, furthermore, did not prevent
him from depriving of their benefices the clergy who had altars in
the church of the Holy Sepulchre, or those in whose custody in-
dulgence funds had been established.1⁷

And thus Arnulf, increasing his power, began to inquire from
the inhabitants of the city where the Cross was which pilgrims had
been accustomed to adore before Jerusalem was taken. Although
they denied (this knowledge), and by oath and other signs were
willing to show that they did not knOW‚ they were at length comm
pelled (to yield) and said this: “It is manifest that God has chosen
you, has delivered you from all tribulation, and has given you this
and many other cities‚ not by the strength of your valor, but by
blinding the impious in His wrath. Your Lord and Guide has
opened to you the most strongly fortified cities and has won fearffi
ful battles for you. Therefore, why should we stubbornly conceal
from you His good gifts‚ since we see that God is with you?’'
After this, they led them to a certain hall in the church, and, un-
earthing the Cross, they gave it up. Thereupon‚ all our men re-
joiced‚ and we returned praise and thanks to Almighty God, who
not only gave us the city in which He had suffered, but likewise the
symbols of His Passion and victory, that we might the more closely
embrace Him with the arms of saith, the more certain the signs
of our salvation that we beheld.

to Lambert, his brother, Bishop of Arras; greeting in Jesus Christ.

Be it known to you, dearest brother, that a true and joyful rumor
has recently come to our ears, which we believe to have corne down
not from human knowledge, but from the Divine Majesty—to wit:
Jerusalem stands on high with joy and gladness which it has so
gloriously received from God in our times. Jerusalem, the city of
