CHAPTER Π

THE MARCH To CoNsTANTINOPLE

(Despite Urban's efforts to keep the expedition within the bounds of
3 common plan and to inaintain some degree of organization, the enthusiasm
which he aroused was too great to be restrained. without waiting for the
appointed day. various 11311115, commonly known as the Peasants Crusade,
started frorn the Rhine country eager to be the first to gain 1116 great 56-
wards. Neither the character nor the conduct of the groups seems to have
been such as to inspire any writer with a desire to recount their deeds. As
3 result, our information about 1116111 6011165 wholly from the none too sym-
pathetic chronicles of 1116 later writers, The versions given by the Anony-
mous, who met 501116 of the survivors at Constantinople‚ by Ekkehard, and
by Albert‚ both of whom lived in the country through which these bands
passed, have been selected as the most accurate and complete. The persecu-
tions of the JeWS, 50 60111111011 along the march of the Ρ63531115. was by no
means, however, confined to 1116111, being almost as widespread as the en-
thusiasm for the Crusade itself.1 , Though the final fate of the first of these
companies is described in the t' d chapter, they had all started before the
main body, and their conduct had left a deep impression upon the peoples
through whose lands they journeyed. The difficulties of the main army in
these same regions were probably due in no small measure to the excesses
which the Peasants had committed. The main armies must be followed up
to Constantinople, as the leaders followed four different routes. The march
of Godfrey and Baldwin is described by Albert‚ that of Bohemund by the
Anonymous, who accompanied him, that of Raymond by his chaplain, Ray-
mond of Aguilers, and that of Robert of Normandy rand Stephen of Blois
by Fulcher, who was with them. Hugh the Great and Robert of Flanders
had no chroniclers in their following, or, at any rate, no detailed account
of their journey to Constantinople has been preserved. Due to the diverse
routes chosen by the leaders, this portion of the history of the First Crusade
is least well substantiated‚ for each of the writers could render accurate
account of only his own army. References to other bands are often in-
accurate and confusing, and even in the story of a single route geographical
allusions are frequently uncertain or incorrect. This 6311 be easily explained
by the fact that the Crusaders were moving fairly rapidly through strange
country, without the stimulus of actual warfare to fix place names in their
minds. Fortunately‚ the well worn Roman roads through the Balkan and
Danube country 631151111 be traced, while the recognizable ple mentioned
by the chroniclers afford ample testimony that the Crusaders followed ‘them in

the main.)
