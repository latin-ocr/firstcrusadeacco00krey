⁸⁶· THE F1RsT causADE 7

position of the {flowing detailed accounts of the First Crusade.⁴

The first complete account of the Crusade which has come down .
to us is commonly known as the Gesta. Its author has attained some s

measure of distinction as the Anonymous. What is known to him,

therefore, rests solely upon the infer-ences to be drawn from his
work. He accompanied the Italian Norman prince, Bohemund,
from the siege of Amalfi to the capture of Antioch. From
there he went to Jerusalem with the general band under Ray-
mond's leadership, whether with Raymond himself or, which
is more likely, with Tancred or Robert of Normandy‚ who were
associated with Raymond, is not clear. His book was written
before the close of 1101, for Ekkehard saw and used a copy of it at
Jerusalem in that year. So much may be stated fairly positively;
the rest is only inferential, for in his book personal references are
singularly few. There is no preface or dedication, no parting re-
mark to the reader. However, certain expressions, certain modifica-
tions of the Latin which he employs, betray a high degree of famili-
arity with the verbal habits of southern Italy, while his constant
laudation of Bohemund, even though he abandoned him after the
capture of Antioch, tends to confirm the belief that his home was
in that region. He may have been a Norman; if so, he left Nor-
mandy long before the First Crusade. His somewhat secular point
of view in regard to events, occasional impersonal remarks upon
the clergy, or participation in battle, have led modern critics to the
belief that he was a knight, though his lack of intimacy with the
leaders would indicate that he was a lesser knight. The style of
his work and the general lack of literary allusions do not bespeak
a very high degree of education. His use of language is that of an
amateur, and his vocabulary is decidedly limited. Unable adequately
to describe the achievements of the various crusaders, he strains
the superlative degree of his adjectives so constantly that occa-
sionally he finds it necessary to lapse into the simple positive as a
means of actual distinction. The Bible is practically the only work
which he quotes. His real piety is sustained both in his book and
in his own career, as is indicated by the fact that he chose to go on to
Jerusalem, instead of remaining with his leader at Antioch. What
he lacks elsewhere is greatly outweighed by his judgment in eval-
uating the relative importance of events, his restraint in preventing
intimate details 'from obscuring the perspective of his story, his
unusual fairness and impartiality toward the rival Christian leaders,
as well as toward his Turkish foes, and a certain native instinct for
the dramatic apparent throughout the book. Guibert, Balderic, and
Robert the Monk all criticized his style, but unwittingly paid him
