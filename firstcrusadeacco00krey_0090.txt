74 THE FIRST CRUSADE

habitants driven out, they rejoiced in the abundance of food found
there. And exulting in that victory, they in turn gave counsel that,
by remaining in that fortress‚ they could easily obtain, through their
own valor, the lands and principality of Soliman3 that they would
gather from all sides booty and food, and thus could easily weaken
Soliman, until the promised army of the great leaders should ap-
proach. Soliman, the leader and chief of the army of the Turks,
having heard of the arrival of the Christians, and of their plunder
and booty, assembled from all Romania and the territory of Cho-
rosan fifteen thousand of his Turks, most agile archers‚ very skilful
in the use of bows of horn and bone. . . . Next, it is said, that
after sunrise on the third day, Soliman with his followers arrived
from Nicaea at the fortress which the Teutons had invaded. . . .

Therefore, the Turks, unable to drive out the Alemanni with this
assault and shower of arrows‚ gathered all kinds of wood at the
very gate of the fortress. They set fire to it and burned the gate
and very many buildings which were within the citadel. As the heat
of the flames became greater, some were burned to death; others,
hoping for safety, leaped from the walls. But the Turks who were
outside the walls cut down with swords those who were fleeing
and took captive about two hundred who were pleasing in appear-
ance and youthful in body; all the others they destroyed with sword
and arrow. . . .

In the meantime, the truth was discovered and tumult arose
among the people. The foot—soldiers came in a body to Reinald of
Broyes, Walter the Penniless, to Walter of BreteuiL also, and to
Folker of Orleans, who were leaders of Peter's army, to urge them
to rise in a body in vindication of their brethren and against the
audacity of the Turks. But they positively refused to go without
the presence and the counsel of Peter. Then Godfrey Burel, master
of the foot—soldiers, upon hearing their response, asserted that the
timid by no means avail so much in war as the b01d; and in sharp
words he frequently reproached those men who prevented their
other companions from pursuing the Turks to avenge their breth-
ren. On the other hand, the leaders of the legion, unable to endure
his insults and reproaches any longer, or those of their own fol-
lowers, were deeply moved by wrath and indignation and promised
that they would go against the strength and wiles of the Turks,
even if it should happen that they died in battle.

Nor was there delay; at dawn on the fourth day, all the knights
and foot-soldiers throughout the entire camp were ordered to arm
themselves, to sound the trumpets, and to assemble for battle. Only
the unarmed, the countless sick‚ and the women remained in camp.
