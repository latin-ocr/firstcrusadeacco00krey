THE FIRST CRUSADE 271

And now the morning of the following day was dawning, and
the watchful host was aroused to the fight by the sound of trumpets
and horns So at daybreak we set forth, drawn up as we have
already described, with guards on every side, and directed the army
of God against the camp of Mohammed. But the enemy lingered
within their camp, thinking that at their approach we would not
even stay inside our walls. For when they heard of the death and
fiight of the herdsmen, they said, “The Franks have come t'or
plunder and have gone back with it.'’ They were being daily in-
formed‚ forsooth, by those who fled from Jerusalem of our small
numbers and of the weakness of our people and horses. Besides,
relying on their number and strength, they believed that they could
drown us and our camp in their spit alone. Likewise, their star-
gazers and soothsayers, as it was reported, said that they ought
neither to move their camp nor fight against us until the seventh
day of the week; that if they wished to do any of these things
earlier, matters would turn out adversely. We advanced, drawn
up in squadrons, as we have said. God multiplied His army

the animals which we had left joined themselves to us and, forming,
herds, though no one drove them, they accompanied us, so that
they stood when we halted, ran when we ran, and advanced with
our advance. The amount of precious spoil was inestimable. More—

their multitude cut to pieces and our men securely and eagerly fight-

themselves, “Flight is our only protection‚ and why delay? If these
men, worn out from their march, almost half dead from hunger
and thirst‚ have today prostrated all our multitude at one charge,
what will they do when rested‚ refreshed, and victorious against uS‚
half destroyed, lessened in number, and terrified?’' Accordingly,
the enemy returned with disturbed mind to Ascalon, which was
about a mile from our camp-—but not all of them.

It then pleased Raymond to send a certain Bohemund, a Turk
by birth, to the Emir under pretense of entering upon a friend-
ship, blaming him because he had been unwilling to surrender
Jerusalem freely and because he had borne arms against us, Bohe-
mund was at the same time to find out whether the Emir was
meditating ssight or battle, and how he conducted himself in defeat.
This Bohemund, moreover, was a Turk by birth, learned in many
tongues, very ingenious and crafty and most loyal to us. . He was
called Bohemund because the great Bohemund had received h1m
