NOTES 297

3 See p. 278.

4See p. 236. The effect of the death of Peter Bartholomew was to dis-
credit the Lance among most of the Crusaders. The expedition of Hugh
of Monteil may be regarded as an effort on the part of the Provencal party
to replace the Lance with an equally venerable relic. According to Albert,
the opposing party, under Arnulf’s leadership, sought to accomplish the same
purpose by making a golden image of the Saviour. However, the place
which the Lance had held among the Crusaders was not filled until the dis-
covery of the Cross at Jerusalem by Arnulf.

⁵ St. Cyprian, not to be confused with the famous Bishop of Carthage‚ was
martyred in Asia Minor during Diocletian’s persecutionS. Chrysostom was
the famous Patriarch of Constantinople, the great preacher, who is num-
bered among the four great Church fathers of the East. Leontius was
probably the Greek theologian of the sixth century, whose surname was
Byzantinus. By Omeclzios is probably meant Onesimus, the disciple of St.
Paul.

⁶This is the fleet to which Raoul refers in his account. Other English
ships are mentioned by the citizen of Lucca in his letter (p. 161). These
ships afforded material aid to the Crusaders on the expedition and afterwards
helped to carry them back to the West.

⁷ Either the author, or the copies of his book are in error, for the eighth
day before the Ides of June was Monday, the sixth. Tudebode says that it
was the third day of the week and the seventh day of incoming June, which
is consistent. See Tudebode, 'Rec. Occid. III, p. 102. The error of the
Anonymous may be purely typographical.

12 Adhemar had died August 1 of the previous year and is mentioned as
having appeared in a vision at the trial of the Lance (p. 198).

⁵1³Eustaee, Count of Boulogne, was the elder brother of Godfrey. He
succeeded to the title and possessions of his father.

1⁵ Arnulf, Bishop of Martirano, who is described by Raoul as a man of
little learning, seems, nevertheless‚ to have had considerable influence. He
was Tancred's chaplain, and, since Tancred captured Bethlehem, his prospect
of obtaining the bishopric was a very good one, especially in view of the
support he rendered to his namesake, Arnulf, chaplain of the Count of
Normandy. In speaking of the capture and death of the Bishop of Marti-
rano, Raymond is here anticipating the event which happened some days
later.

1⁶ The palms were the sign of the completed pilgrimage. It was custo-
mary for pilgrims to bring home palms frorn the Jordan. See p. 274.

17 Allowance must be made for Raymond's intense hatred of the man who,
more than any other individual, was responsible for discrediting the Lance.
