THE FIRST CRUSADE 195

follow Christ, and admonished us to exalt the Christian name—we
bid you complete the task which you urged; come to us and per-
suade all whom you can to come with you. For here the blessed
Peter was enthroned in the church which we see daily, and those
who before were called Galileans1 were here first in general called
Christians. What in the world, therefore, can seem more proper
than that you, who stand forth as the father and head of the Chris-
tian religion, should come to the first and chief city of the Chris-
tian name, and complete on your part the war which is your own?
For we have driven out the Turks and pagans; the heretics‚ how-
ever, Greeks and Armenians, Syrians, and JacobiteS,² we cannot
expel. We bid γοα, therefore. again and again, our most beloved
father, come as father and head to the place of your fatherhood,
and, as the vicar of St. Peter, take your seat in his church and have
us as your obedient sons in well doing. Root out and destroy all
heresy of whatever kind by your authority and our valor, and thus
complete the expedition of Jesus Christ, begun by us, and preached
by yourself. And, likewise, open to us the gates of both Jerusalems,
make free the Sepulchre of the Lord and exalt the Christian name
above every name. For, if you will come to us, and with us finish
the expedition begun by you, all the world will be obedient to you.
May He Himself cause you to do this, who liveth and reigneth God
for ever and ever. Amen.

A matter has been related to me which, indeed, is very much
against God and all worshippers of Christ; namely, that persons
signed with the cross hold permission from you to remain among
Christians. I marvel greatly at this, because, since you are the
instigator of this holy journey¹ those who put off that journey ought
to receive neither counsel nor anything good from you until they
have fulfilled the journey which they began. And it is not only our
concern that you thus disturb the good which you have begun but,
also, that you should strengthen us by the coming of yourself and
all whom you can lead with you. For it is fitting that we. who by
God’s help and your pious prayers are possessors of all Romania,
Cilicia, Asia, and Syria, should have you, after God, as our aid and
succour. Moreover‚ most holy father, you ought to separate us,
sons obedient to you in all things, from the unJ'ust Emperor who
has made us many good promises, but has not at all carried them
out. For he has caused us all the ill and hindrance which he could.
