THE FIRsT cRUsADE 259

Zion, but they had much assistance from William Embriaco and
the Genoese sailors, who, although they had lost their ships at
Joppa‚ as we have already related, had been able, nevertheless, to
save ropes, mallets, spikes, axes, and hatchets, which were very
necessary to 115. But why delay the story? The appointed day
arrived and the attack began. However, Ι want to say this first,
that, according to our estimate and that 01 many others, there were
sixty thousand fighting men within the city, not counting the women
and those unable to bear arms, and there were not many 01 these.
At the most we did not have more than twelve thousand able to bear
arms, 101 there were many poor people and many sick. There
were twelve or thirteen hundred knights in our army, as I reckon
it, not more. Ι say this that you may realize that nothing, whether
great or small, which is undertaken in the name 01 1116 Lord can
fail, as the following pages show.

Our men began to undermine the towers and walls. From
every side stones were hurled from the tormenti and the petrariae,
and so many arrows that they fell like hail. The servants 01 God
bore this patiently, sustained by the premises 01 their saith, whether
they should be killed or should presently prevail over their enemies.
The battle showed no indication 01 victory, but when the machines
were drawn nearer to the walls, they hurled not only stones and
arrows, but also burning wood and straw. The wood was dipped
in pitch, wax, and sulphur; then straw and tow were fastened on
by an iron band, and. when lighted‚ these firebrands were shot from
the machines. (They were) all bound together by an iron band,
Ι say, so that wherever they fell, the whole mass held together and
continued to burn. Such missiles, burning as they shot upward‚
could not be resisted by swords or by high walls; it was not even
possible 101 1116 defenders to find safety down behind the walls.
Thus the fight continued from the rising to the setting sun in such
splendid fashion that it is difficult to believe anything more glorious
was ever done. Then we called on Almighty God‚ our Leader and
Guide, confident in His mercy. Night brought 1631 10 both sides.
The Saracens feared that we would take the city during the night
or on the next day, 101 1116 011161 works were broken through and
the ditch was filled, so that it was possible to make an entrance
through the wall very quickly. On our part, we feared only that
the Saracens would set fire to the machines that were moved close
to the walls, and thus improve their situation. So on both sides it
was a night 01 watchfulness, labor, and sleepless cantion: on one
side, most certain hope, on the other doubtful fear. We gladly

labored to capture the city 101 1116 glory 01 God‚ they less willingly
