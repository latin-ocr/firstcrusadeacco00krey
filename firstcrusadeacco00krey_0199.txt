THE FIRST CRUSADE 177

the Count of St. Gilles and Peter Raymond of Hautpoul‚ and say
these words to them: “why has the Bishop 'neglected to preach
and admonish and daily to sign his people with the cross which he
bears before them, for it would profit them much ?’' ’ And he added,
‘Come and I will show thee the Lance of our father, Jesus Christ,
which thou shalt give to the Count. For God has granted it to
him ever since he was bor11.'

“I arose, therefore, and followed him into the city, dressed in
nothing except a shirt. And he led me into the church of the
apostle of St. Peter through the north gate, before which the
Saracens had built a mosque. In the church‚ indeed, were two
lamps, which there gave as much light as if the sun had illuminated
it. And he said to me, ‘Wait here.' And he commanded me to sit
upon a column, which was closest to the stairs by which one ascends
to the altar from the south; but his companion stood at a distance
before the altar steps. Then St. Andrew, going under ground,
brought forth the Lance and gave it into my hands.

“And he said to me ‘Eehold the Lance which opened His side,
whence the salvation of the whole world has come.’

“While I held it in my hands, weeping for joy, I said to him,

“After these things had been so done, he led me back over the
wall to my home; and so they left me. Then I thought to myself
of the condition of my poverty and your greatness, and I feared to
approach you. After this, when I had set forth for food to a certain
fortress which is near Edessa, on the first day of Lent at cock—crow,
St. Andrew appeared to me in the same garb and with the same
companion with whom he had corne before, and a great brightness
filled the house. And St. Andrew said ‘Art thou awake ?’

“Thus aroused, I replied ‘No, Lord; my Lord, I am not asleep.’

“And he said to me ‘Hast thou told those things which Ι bade
thee tell some time ago ?'

“And I answered ‘Lord, have Ι not prayed thee to send some one
else to them, for, fearful of my poverty, Ι hesitated to go before
them ?’

“And he said ‘Dost thou not know why the Lord led you hither,
and how much He loves you and why He chose you especially?
He made you come hither (to rebuke) contempt of Him and to
avenge His people. He loves you so dearly that the saints already
at rest, fore-knowing the grace of Divine arrangements, wished
