man He wished to have a Roman bishop in the Oriental church.

2. Disputes between Raymond and Bolzemund. (November 1, 1098-
January 13, 1099.)

(Gesta.) But as the‘time set approached, that is the Feast of
All Saints‚ all our leaders returned to Antioch and together began
to seek how they might accomplish the journey to the Holy Sepul-
chre‚ saying: “Since the time set for going has arrived, there is not
time for further quarrelling.'‘ Bohemund, however, daily sought
(confirmation of) the agreement which all the leaders had long ago
made with him to give him the city.⁷ But the Count of St. Gilles
wished to commit himself to no agreement with Bohemund‚ be-
cause he feared to perjure himself with the Emperor. Neverthe-
less, they often assembled in the Church of St. Peter to do what
was just. Bohemund recited his agreement and presented his reck-
oning. The Count of St. Gilles‚ likewise‚ laid bare his words and
the oath which he had made to the Emperor on the advice of Bo-
hemund. The bishops, Duke Godt‘rey, the Count of Flanders‚ the
Count of Normandy, and the other leaders separated from the rest
and entered (the space) where the chair of St. Peter stands, there
to decide upon a judgment between the two. But tearing later that
the journey to the Holy Sepulchre might be interrupted‚ they were
unwilling to make public their judgment. Then the Count of St.
Gilles said: “Rather than see the way to the Holy Sepulchre (un-
achieved), if Bohemund will consent to go with us, Ι will faithfully
agree to whatever our peers (to wit, Duke Godfrey, the Count of
Flanders‚ Robert of Normandy‚ and the other seignors) approve,
saving sealty to the Emperor.”⁸ Bohemund approved of all this,
and both promised in the hands of a bishop that the journey to the
Holy Sepulchre would in no way be disturbed by them. Then
Bohemund took counsel with his vassals‚ how with men and pro-
visions he might fortify the citadel on the high mountain. The
Count of St. Gilles, likewise‚ took counsel with his men, how he
might fortify with men and provisions enough for a long time the
palace of Cassianus, and the tower which is above the gate of the
bridge, on the side toward the Port of St. Simeon. ÷ ι ι ·

This city of Antioch is indeed very beautiful and glorious‚ since
within its walls are four very large and exceedingly high mountains.
On the higher one has been built a castle‚ wonderful and exceed-
ingly strong. Down below is the city glorious, near at hand and
adorned with honors of all kinds, since many churches have been
built within it. It contains three hundred and sixty monasteries,
