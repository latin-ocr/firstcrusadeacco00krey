178 THE FIRsT CRUSADE

has chosen you from all peoples, as grains of wheat are gathered
from the oats. For you excel in favor and rewards all who may

“After this they withdrew, and such illness oppressed me that
Ι was about to lose the light of my eyes, and I was arranging to
dispose of my very meagre belongings„ Then Ι began to meditate
that these things had justly befallen me because of my neglect
of the apostolic command. Thus comforted, I returned to the
siege. Thinking again of the handicap of my poverty, I began to
fear that if I went to you, you would say that Ι was a serf and
was telling this for the sake of food; therefore, Ι was silent instead.
And thus in the course of time, when at the Port of St. Simeon on
Palm Sunday Ι was lying down in the tent with my lord, William
Peter, St. Andrew appeared with a companion. Clad in the same
