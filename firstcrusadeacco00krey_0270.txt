248 THE FIRST CRUSADE

But when the Saracens who lived in Ramlah heard that we had
crossed the river near by, they left their fortifications and arms,
and much grain in the fields, and crops, which we gathered. And
when we came to it on the next day, we found out that God was
truly fighting for uS. So we offered vows to St. George because
he had confessed himself our guide. The leaders and all the
people agreed that we should there choose a bishop, since* that was
the first church which we found in the land of Israel, and, also,
in order that St. George might entreat God in our behalf, and might
lead us faithfully through the land in which He was not wor-
shipped. Moreover‚ Ramlah is about fifteen miles from Jerusalem.
Therefore, we there held a conference.

Some said, “Let us not go to Jerusalem at present, but towards
Egypt; we will obtain not only Jerusalem, but likewise Alexandria
and Babylon and very many kingdoms. If we go to Jerusalem and,
failing of sufficient water, give up the siege, we will accomplish
neither this nor the other afterwards.”

But others said in opposition‚ “There are scarcely fifteen hundred
knights in the army, and the number of armed men is not great;
and yet it is now suggested that we go to very distant and unknown
regions, where we will be able neither to get help from our people
nor to place a garrison in a city, if we capture one; nor, even if it
should be necessary, would we be able to return thence. But none
of this; let us hold to our way, and let God provide for His servants
'for the siege, for thirst‚ for hunger, and for other things !’'

Accordingly, after leaving a garrison in the fortress of Ramlah

,i with the new Bishop‚ we loaded our camels and oxen, and then

all our baggage animals and horses, and turned our march to Jeru-
salem. However, the word which Peter Bartholomew had com-
manded us—that we should not approach Jerusalem exceptlwith bared
feet—we forgot and held in low regard, each one, from ambition to
occupy castles and villas, wishing to go ahead of the next. For
it was a custom among us that if any one came to a castle or villa
first and placed his standard there with a guard, it was touched by
no one else afterward. Therefore, because of this ambition they
arose at midnight and, without waiting for companions, gained all
those mountains and villas which are in the meadows of the Jordan.
A few, however, to whom the command of God was more preciom,
walked with naked feet and sighed heavily for the contempt of the
Divine word; and yet no one recalled a companion or friend from
that ambitious chase. Moreover‚ when by such arrogant procedure
we had come near Jerusalem, the people of Jerusalem came forth
to meet the first of our rnen and wounded the horses severely. Of
those men three or four fell on that day, and many were wounded.
