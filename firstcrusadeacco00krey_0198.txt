176 THE FIRST CRUSADE

Accordingly, upon hearing the statements of that man who re-
ported to us the revelation of Christ through the words of the
apostle, we went in haste immediately to the place in the church
of St. Peter which he had pointed out. Thirteen men (lug there
from morning until vespers. And so that man found the Lance,
just as he had indicated. They received it with great gladness and
fear, and a joy beyond measure arose in the whole city-‚aj-

(Raymond). And so, as we said, when our men were in a panic
and while they were on the verge of despair, divine mercy was at
hand for them3 and that mercy which had corrected the children
when they were wanton, consoled them when they were very sad,
in the following way. Thus, when the city of Antioch had been
captured, the Lord‚ employing His power and kindness, chose a
certain poor peasant, Provencal by race, through whom He com-
forted us; and He sent these words to the Count and Bishop of
Puy:

“Anrlrevv, apostle of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ, has
recently admonished me a fourth time and has commanded me to
come to you and to give back to yon, after the city was captured,
the Lance which opened the side of the Saviour. To-day, moreover,
when Ι had set out from the city with the rest to battle, and when,
caught between two horsemen‚ Ι was almost suffocated on the re-
treat, I sat down sadly upon a certain rock, almost lifeless. W hen
I was reeling like a woe-begone from fear and grief, St. Andrew
came to me with a companion, and he threatened rne much unless
I returned the Lance to you quickly.”

And when the Count and Bishop asked him to tell in order the
apostolic revelation and command, he replied: “At the first earth-
quake which occurred at Antioch when the army of the Franks
was besieging it. such fear assailed me that Ι could say nothing ex-
cept ‘God help me.' For it was night, and Ι was lying d0wn; nor
was there anyone else in my hut to sustain me by his presence.
When, moreover, the shaking of the earth had lasted a long time,
and my fear had ever increased‚ two men stood before me in the
brightest raiment. The one was older, with red and white hair,
black eyes, and kindly face, his beard, indeed, white, wide, and thick,
and his stature medium; the other was younger and taller, hand-
some in form beyond ‚the children of men. And the older said to
me ‘What doest thou ?' and I was very greatly frightened because
I knew that there was no one present. And Ι answered, ‘Who art
thou ?’

“He replied, ‘Rise, and fear not; and heed what I say to thee.
