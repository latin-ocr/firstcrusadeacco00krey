104 THE FIRST CRUSADE

the Alemanni who were on the east, the other party, entering the
middle gate of the city and passing out through another, would
ea's'ily drive our men from the camp at a time when they were not
expecting such an attack. But God, who is wont to reverse the
plan of the impious, so altered their preparations that, as if it
had been arranged, He sent the Count, who was preparing to en-
camp with his men, upon the squadron of Turks which was now
about to enter the city. He put them to ssight at the first charge
and, after killing several, pursued the rest to the top of the moun-
tain. The other party of Turks which wanted to attack the Ale-
manni was put to ssight in the same way and destroyed. After this,
machines were constructed and the wall attacked in vain, for
it was very firm against us and was valiantly defended by ar-
rows and machines. So we fought five weeks with no result. At
length, through God's will, some men of the household of the Bishop
and the Count dangerously enough approached the corner tower
which faced the east, and having made a testudo,²1 they began,
after a struggle, to undermine one of the towers and by digging
threw it to the ground. Thus the city would have been taken, had
not the shadows of night prevented. However, the wall was re-
built during the night, and this rendered our former labor vain.
At length the city, terrified with fear, was compelled to surrender.
One reason was that the ships of the Emperor which had been
dragged over the land were let down into the lake. They therefore
gave themselves up to the Emperor, since they now expected no
further aid and saw the army of the Franks increasing daily, while
they were cut off- from their forces. The Count of Normandy had
come. Alexius had promised the princes and the people of the
Franks that he would give them all the gold, silver‚ horses‚ and
goods within (the city), and that he would establish there a Latin
monastery and hospice for the poor Franks; besides, that he would
give to each one of the army so much of his own possessions that
they would always want to fight for him. Accordingly, the Franks,
placing faith in these promises, approved the surrender. And so,
when Alexius had received the city, he afforded the army such an
example of gratitude that as long as they live the people will curse
him and proclaim him a traitor.

We recognized, then, that the Emperor had betrayed Peter the
Hermit, who had long before come to Constantinople with a great
multitude. For he compelled him, ignorant of the locality and of all
military matters, to cross the Strait with his men and exposed them
to the Turks. Moreover, when the Turks from Nicaea saw that
unwarlike multitude, they cut them down without effort and delay
