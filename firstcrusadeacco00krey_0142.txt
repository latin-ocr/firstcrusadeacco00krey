122 THE FIRST CRUSADE

had no son or daughter, and since he was unable to defend himself
against the Turks‚ this Greek wished himself and his land to be
defended by this Baldwin, for he had heard that both he and his
soldiers were most brave fighters.

As soon as Baldwin had heard this offer, and had been persuaded
of its truth by the oath of the (leputies from Edessa, he set out
with his little army of about eighty knights and crossed the Eu-
phrates. After we had crossed this river, we went on very hastily
all night and, very much afraid, we passed between the Saracen
forts, leaving them on either side of us. XVhen the Turks in the
fortified town of Samosata had heard this, they set ambush for us
along the way by which they thought we would go. But the fol—
lowing night a certain Armenian most hospitably entertained us in
his castle and warned us to guard ourselves from the ambush of
the enemy. VVherefore, for two days we remained concealed in
this place. But the Turks‚ wearied by such delay, on the third day,
rushed down in a sudden onslaught from their place of hiding and,
with flags flying‚ ran before the stronghold in which we were; and
the booty which they found there in the pastures they seized before
our eyes. We went out against them; but because we were too
few, we were unable to contend with them. They shot arrows‚ but
wounded none of us. However, they left in camp one of their men
killed with a lance. His horse was kept by the one who unhorsed
him. Then the pagans left, but we stayed there. The following
day we resumed our journey and passed in front of the Armenian
forts. When they heard that we were going to defendvthem from
the Turks, under whose yoke they ha'd for so long been oppressed,
it was wonderful to see how they advanced to meet us, humbly and
for the love of God. They carried crosses and banners, and they
kissed our robes and our feet. .

(February 20, 1098.) At length we reached Edessa where the
aforesaid Duke of the city and his wife, together with the citizens,
gladly received us: and what had been promised to Baldwin they
fulfilled at once. After we had delayed there for fifteen days, the
citizens wickedly plotted to kill their prince because they hated-
him, and to set up Baldwin as ruler over the land in his place.
This was suggested; and it was done. Baldwin and his men were
much grieved that they were not able to obtain merey for him: As
soon as Baldwin had accepted as a gift from the citizens the princi-
pality of this man who had been wickedly murdered‚ he began a
war against the Turks who were in the country. Often he con-v
quered, either killing or taking them prisoners. However, it hap-
pened, also, that many of our men were killed by the Turks.
