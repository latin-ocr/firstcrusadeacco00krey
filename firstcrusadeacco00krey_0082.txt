66 THE FIRST CRUSADE

and, as I may also say, about alliance; this, however, was a snare
in words. For in front and behind, to right and to left, Turks and
Cumans, Uzi, Tenaces,26 Patzinaks, and Bulgarians were lying in
ambush for us.

On a cert'ain day, moreover, when we were in the valley of Pela-
gonia, the Bishop of Puy, who, in order to find a comfortable rest-
ing place, had withdrawn a little distance from the camp, was cap-
tured by the Patzinaks. They knocked him down from his mule,
robbed him, and beat him severely on the head. But since so great
a pontiff was still necessary to the people of (jod, through God's
mercy he was saved to life. For one of the Patzinaks, in order to
obtain gold from him, protected him from the others. Meanwhile,
the noise was heard in the camp3 and so, between the delay of the
enemy and the attack of his friends, he was rescued.

When we had come amidst treachery of this fashion to a certain
fortress called Buci‘nat,²⁷ the Count learned that the Patzinaks in-
tended to attack our army in the passes of a certain mountain.
Staying in hiding with some of his knights, he came upon the
Patzinaks, and, after killing several of them, he turned the rest to

the city with a few men.

After this, we came to a certain city, Rusa by name, where, since
its citizens were plainly disposed to do us evil, our usual patience
was somewhat disturbed. So, taking up arms, we destroyed the
outer walls, seized great plunder, and forced the city to surrender;
then, having taken our standards into the city and shouted “Tou-
lousel³⁹ which was the battle cry of the Count, we departed.

We came to another city, called Rodosto. When knights in the
pay of the Emperor there sought to carry out his vengeance upon
us, many of them were killed and a quantity of plunder taken.
There, also, the envoys whom we had sent ahead to the Emperor
came to us and, having received money from him, promised that
everything boded well for us with the Emperor. What more? The
message (brought) by our envoys and those οἱ the Emperor was
that the Count, leaving his army behind, should hasten unarmed
and with a few men to the Emperor. For they said that Bohemund‚
the Duke of Lorraine, the Count of Flanders, and other princes
made this prayer: that the Count should hasten to agree with the
Emperor about the march to Jerusalem; that the Emperor, having
taken the cross, should also become leader in the army of God. In
addition to this, they reported that the Emperor had said that he
