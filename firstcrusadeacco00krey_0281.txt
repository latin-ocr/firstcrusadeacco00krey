THE FIRST CRUSADE 257

Count Raymond brought his army and his tower up near the
wall from the south, but between the tower and the wall there
was a very deep ditch. Then our men took counsel how they might
fill it, and had it proclaimed by heralds that anyone who carried
three stones to the ditch would receive one denarius. The work of
filling it required three days and three nightS‚ and when at
length the ditch was filled, they moved the tower up to the
wall, but the men defending this portion of the wall fought
desperately with stones and fire. When the Count heard that the
Franks were already in the city, he said to his men, “Why do you
loiter? Lo, the Franks are even now within the city.'’ The Emir
who commanded the Tower of St. David surrendered to the Count
and opened that gate at which the pilgrims had always been accus-
tomed to pay tribute. But this time the pilgrims entered the city,
pursuing and killing the Saracens up to the Temple of Solomon,
where the enemy gathered in force. The battle raged throughout
the day, so that the Temple was covered with their blood. When
the pagans had been overcome, our men seized great numbers, both
men and women, either killing them or keeping them captive, as
they wished. On the roof of the Temple a great number of pagans
of both sexes had assembled, and these were taken under the pro-
tection of Tancred and Gaston of Beert. Afterward, the army
scattered throughout the city and took possession οἱ the gold and
silver, the horses and mules, and the houses filled with goods of
all kinds.

Later, all of our people went to the Sepulchre of our Lord,
rejoicing· and weeping for joy, and they rendered up the offering
that they owed. In the morning, some of our men cautiously
ascended to the roos of the Temple and attacked the Saraoens, both
men and women, beheading them with naked swords; the remainder
sought death by jumping down into the temple. When Tancred
heard of this, he was filled with anger.

(Raymond.) The Duke and the Counts of Normandy and
Flanders placed Gaston of Beert in charge of the workmen who
constructed machines. They built mantlets and towers with which
to attack the wall. The direction of this work was assigned to
Gaston by the princes because he was a most noble lord‚ respected
by all for his skill and reputation. He very cleverly hastened matters
by dividing the work. The princes busied themselves with obtaining
and bringing the material, while Gaston supervised the work of con-
struction. Likewise‚ Count Raymond made William Ricau superin-
tendent of the work on Mount Zion and placed the Bishop of Albara
in charge of the Saracens and others who brought in the timber.
