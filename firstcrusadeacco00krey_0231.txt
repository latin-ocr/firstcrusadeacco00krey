THE FIRST CRUSADE 209

who wish to have the Emperor’s gold have it, and those who wish
to have the revenues of Antioch, likewise. Let us, however, takc
up our march with Christ as leader, for whom we have come. Let
those who want to hold Antioch perish miserably, as its inhabitants
recently perished. If this great dispute about Antioch is con-
tinued longer, let us tear down its walls, and the peace which held
the princes together before the city was taken will unite them after
it has been destroyed. Nay, before we waste away utterly here
from starvation and disease‚ we ought to return to our own homes.''
For these and other reasons the Count and Bohemund made dis-
cordant peace between themselves. So when the day had been
fixed, the people were ordered to prepare for the avowed journey.

Accordingly, when the necessary preparations had been made and
the day fixed, the Count of St. Gilles and the Count of Flanders
set out with the people into Syria, and there they besieged Marra,
a very rich and populous city. Marsa was about eight miles from
Barra. Its citizens were so haughty, because, at one time in a cer-
tain fight they had killed many of our men, that they cursed our
army and maligned the princes, and, to provoke us most, they
placed crosses upon the walls and plied them with insults. For
this reason, therefore, on the second day after our arrival, we as-
sailed them so fiercely that if we had had four more ladders the
city would have been taken: but since we had only two, and those
so short and fragile that one climbed upon them timidly‚ it was
decided that machines, hurdles, and mounds be constructed, by means
of which the wall could be forced, undermined, and levelled. In
the meantime, Bohemund carne with his army and besieged it from
the other side. Again, without having prepared the machines which
we spoke of above, as if because of the encouragement of Bohe-
mund, who had not been present at the former assault, we wished
to attack the city by filling the moat. But this was in vain, for we
then fought much worse than we did before. After this, there was
such famine in the army that, pitiful to say, you could see ten thou-
sand men going about the fields like cattle, digging and looking
(to see) if by chance they might find grains of wheat‚ or barley‚
or beans, or the grains of any other legume. In the meanwhile,
though the machines of which we spoke above were being prepared
to take the city by storm, nevertheless some of our men, upon see-
ing the misery of our people and the boldness of the Saracens,
despaired of God's mercy and fied.

But God, who has concern for His followers‚ did not permit His
people whom He saw placed in extreme tribulation to suffer too
far. Therefore He sent word to us through His blessed apostles
