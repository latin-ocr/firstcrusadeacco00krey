THE FIRST CRUSADE 63

mained there for several days and sought a market‚ but the people
were unwilling to accord it to υς, because they feared us greatly,
thinking that we came not as pilgrims, but to devastate their land
and to kill them. Wherefore we took their cattle, horses, asses, and
everything that we found. Leaving Castoria‚ we entered Pelagonia,
in which there was a certain fortified town of heretics. This we
attacked from all sides and it soon yielded to our sway. Thereupon,
we set it on fire and burned the camp with its inhabitants, that is,
the congregation of heretics. Later, we reached the river Vardar.
And then Lord Bohemund went across with his people, but not
with all, for the Count of Rosciynolo with his brothers remained
behind.

Thereupon, an army of the Emperor came and attacked the Count
with his brothers and all who were with them. Tancred, hearing
of this, went back and, hurling himself into the river, reached the
others by swimming; and two thousand went into the river fol-
lowing Tancred. At length, they came upon the Turcopoles²4 and
Patzinaks struggling with our men. They (Tancred and his men)
charged the enemy suddenly and bravely and overcame them glori-
ously. Several of them they seized and led them, bound, into the
presence of Bohemund, who spoke to them as follows: “Where-
fore, miserable men, do you kill Christ’s people and mine? I have
no quarrel with your Emperor.'' They replied, “We cannot do
otherwise; we have been placed in the service of the Emperor,
and whatever he commands we must fulfill.” Bohemund allowed
them to depart unpunished. This battle was fought in the fourth
day of the week, which is the beginning of the fast. Through all,
blessed is the Lord! Amen.

The unhappy Emperor sent one of his own men, whom he
greatly loved, and whom they call C orpalatius‚2⁵ together with our
envoyS‚ to conduct us in security through his land until *we should
come to Constantinople. And as we paused before their cities, he
ordered the inhabitants to offer us a market, just as those also did
of whom we have spoken. Indeed‚ they feared the most brave host
of Lord Bohemund so greatly that they permitted none of us to
enter the walls of the city, Our men wanted to attack and seize
a certain fortified town because it was full of all kinds of goods.
But the renowned man, Bohemund, refused to consent, not only in
justice to the land, but also because of his pledge to the Emperor.
Therefore‚ he was greatly angered on this account with Tancred
and all the rest. This happened toward evening. When morning
came, the inhabitants of the town came out, and, in procession, bear-
ing crosses in their hands, they came into the presence of Bohe-
