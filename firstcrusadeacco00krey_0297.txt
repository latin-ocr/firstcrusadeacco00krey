THE FIRST CRUSADE 273

After we had passed by Gibellum, we overtook Bohemund camped
in his tents before the city Valenium. There was with him a certain

Archbishop of Pisa, Daimbert by 11a1ne,²¹ who, with some 'fuscans
and Italians, had come by ship to the port of Laodicaea, and who
was there waiting to go with us. The Bishop of Apulia was there,
too. With Lord Baldwin there was a third bishop. We estimated
the number of those thus assembled in friendship to be twenty-five
thousand of both sexes, foot-soldiers as well as knights.

When we had reached the interior states of the Saracens, we were
unable to obtain from the wicked inhabitants of the region any
bread or food ot‘ any kind. There was no one who would give or
sell it to us, and, as our provisions were being more and more used
up, it happened that many were cruelly tortured by hunger. Horses,
too, and mules suffered doubly for lack of food. They traveled,
but they ate not. However, in those cultivated fields through which
we passed on our march, there were certain ripe plants, very much
like reeds, which the people called cannamelles. The name is com-
posed of the words canna and mel, whence, I think, it is also called
wood-honey‚22 which is skilfully made from it. Almost famished,
we chewed these all day long for the flavor of the honey, which,
however, helped but little. Thus for the love of God we endured
this and many other ills, such as hunger, cold, and heavy rains.
Many, lacking bread, ate horses, mules, and camels. Besides the ex-
cessive cold, we were tormented very often by showers of rain; and
the heat of the sun was not sufficient to enable us to dry our wet
clothes thoroughly before another rain would harass us for four
or five days. Then I saw many who had no tents die from ex-
posure to the cold rain. I, Fulcher of Chartres‚ who was with
them, saw many persons of both sexes and a great many beasts
die from the very cold rain one day. It would be long to tell and
tedious to listen to all the details of their suffering; for no trouble
or sorrow escaped the people of God. Osten many Franks were
killed by the Saracens who lurked along the way in narrow paths,
or wherever our men went in search of food. You might have seen
mounted knights of noble birth become simple foot-soldiers, after
having lost their horses in one way or another. As the baggage
animals failed, you might have seen sheep and goats„ stolen from
the Saracens, heavily laden with baggage‚ which by its weight
skinned their backs. Twice on the way, and no oftener, we had
bread and grain, bought at exorbitant prices from the people of
Tripoli and Caesarea. From this it is manifest that one can scarcely
get any great good without great labor. It was indeed a great bless-

ing when we finally arrived at Jerusalem.
