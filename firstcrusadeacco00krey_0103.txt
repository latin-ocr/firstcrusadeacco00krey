THE FIRST CRUSADE 85

carried at once by boat through the Strait to Constantinople. Ac-
companied by the distinguished men, Werner of GreZ, Peter of
Dampierre, and the other leaders, he boldly advanced to the Court
of the Emperor and stood before him, that he might hear his word
and reply to him by word of mouth. Baldwin, however, by no
means entered then into the palace of the Emperor, but remained
on the shore with the multitude.

Upon seeing the magnificence of the Duke and all his men, hon-
orably clad, as they were, in splendid and rich apparel of purple
and gold, bordered with ermine white as snOW‚ with martin, and
other kinds of fur, such as the princes of Gaul, especially, wear,
the Emperor heartily admired their pomp and splendor. He first
graciously received the Duke, then all his chiefs and companions,
whom he honored with the kiss of peace. Moreover, the Emperor
sat in majesty upon his throne, according to his custom‚ and did
not rise to give the kiss to the Duke, or anyone. But the Duke,
together with his men, bowed with bended knees to kiss so glorious

who followed the Duke in the ceremony. Nor was there delay.
Invaluable gifts of all kinds were brought from the treasury of
the Emperor, both gold and silver‚ purples, mules, and homes, and
all that he held valuable. So, indeed, the Emperor and the Duke
were bound by the indissoluble bond of perfect faith and friend-
ship‚ from the time of the N ativity of the Lord, when the agreement
took place, even to a few days before Pentecost. Every week, four
men, bearing gold besants, with ten measures of money called tar-
taron, were sent from the palace of the Emperor to the Duke to
provide sustenance for the soldiers. Wonderful to relate! All,
that the ‘Duke distributed to his men from the gifts of the Emperor
was forthwith returned to the treasury of the Emperor in exchange
for food. Nor is this to be wondered at, for none but the Emper-
or's wares (such as wine, and oil, as well as grain, barley, and every
kind of food) were in that whole kingdom. And thus the treasury
