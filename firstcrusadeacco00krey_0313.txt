the whole eastern Roman Empire; (b) Asia Minor; (c) the Sultanate of
the Turks in Asia Minor, known as the Sultanate of Rum, or Roum. Here
the last is apparently meant.

⁵The inconsistent statements of the different writers make exact identi-
fication of Xeroyord impossible.

⁹One of the commanders of the Byzantine fleet.

¹01n the original the title of this man is “dux-:¹ but to avoid confusion
with the ¹Latin title, which conferred a somewhat different distinction, the
term is here translated “governor.”

¹1 An honorary title reserved for members of the imperial family.

12 Good Friday, April 2, 1081, when, through the treason of German
mercenaries within the city, Alexius succeeded in entering Constantinople.
His reign is usually dated from this event.

13 Nicephorus Bryennius, husband of Anna Comnena.

14Α place just across the Strait from Constantinople, not as yet identified.

¹5 See Introduction to Chapter ΙΙΙ, p. 69.

16Α reference to the earlier fighting between the Italian Normans and
Alexius—certainly not to the battle at Larissa, when Bohemund was forced
to retreat. Anna, in her references to this former hostility between Alexius
and Bohemund, is inclined to lay greater stress upon Larissa. The Emper-
or's war with Robert Guiscard and Bohemund took place from 1082-1084.

1⁷ The mention of Antioch as a specific part of Bohemund’s agreement is
not confirmed by the other writers, nor is it mentioned in connection with
later disputes about Antioch. The point raises a question as to whether
the Anonymous ‘wrote this portion of his work before or after Antioch was
taken.

¹⁸ The allusion is to William the Conqueror, whose gifts to the knights in
his following after the battle of Senlac had evidently become proverbial.

families in the East and was a trusted friend of Alexius from the beginning
of his reign.
