234 THE FIRST CRUSADE

forth to meet our men, ready to fight with them. There is a very
strong and high wall of an acqeduct into the city, between which

and the sea there is not much space; for the sea encircles Tripoli '

on three sides. Accordingly, the Saracens fortified this wall of the
aqueduct, which we have mentioned, so that if any misfortune befell
them they could go forth and return, as though from castle to
castle. And thus when our men saw this multitude, relying upon
the place of their arms, they called upon God, and with upraised
spears the foot-soldiers and knights went up to them in a body, as
if in a procession, so that if you had seen our men you would have
believed or said that they were friends, not enemies. The land
is now polluted with the blood of the Moors, and the aqueduct
filled with their dead bodies. Such fear did the Lord cast down
upon the enemy that scarcely any of them could fiee after the first
blows. It was indeed very delightful to behold the stream of the
aqueduct bear the beheaded corpses of nobles and people swiftly
into the city. One or two of our men fell there; but of the enemy,
we heard that as many as seven hundred had fallen.

And thus, upon returning with a great victory and many spoils,
our princes said to the people‚ “This (lay the King of Tripoli saw
us, and we saw the roads to the city and have considered its ap-
proaches. And now, if you approve, we have decided that tomor-
row the king may find out what kind of knights we are.’' When,
therefore, they returned on the next day, they found no one outside
the wall. After this moreover the King of Trpioli sent word to our-
princes that if they would desist from the siege of Archas, he would
give them fifteen thousand gold coins, horses, mules, raiment, and
food, and that he would afford a marketof all goods for all the
people 3 in addition to this, that he would return all our people whom
he held captive.

At this time envoys from the Emperor Alexius came to us with
very great complaints against Bohemund, because he was retaining
the city of Antioch against the oaths which he had made to the
Emperor. Bohemund was holding Antioch at this time, for upon
hearing that the Count had set forth from Marra into the interior
of Syria, he violently expelled the Count’s men from the towers of
Antio-ch which they were guarding. Alexius further sent word to
our princes that he would give them much gold and silver and
would come with them to Jerusalem, and that they should wait for
him until the Festival of St. John.¹⁹ Easter was then at hand.

Many, among whom was the Coum, for this reason said: “Let
us wait for the Emperor and we will gain both his gifts and himself.
He will cause a market to come by land and by sea, and we will be
