2 THE FIRST CRUSADE

As for the thousands who finally succeeded in overcoming the almost
superhuman obstacles involved in the conquest of the holy places,
what wonders did they not have to relate! Individuals and occa-
sional bands of pilgrims had journeyed over the same route before
the Crusaders, but they were relatively so few that their experiences
were absorbed within their own limited localities and left few traces..
The First Crusade, however, enlisted people of all classes, of both
sexes, and every age, drawing them from practically all parts of
Christian Europe. As the first bands proceeded through district
after district, others caught the spirit and started after them. And
thus the narrow highways were choked with a constant stream of
Crusaders, some hurrying eastward, others returning home. Nor
did the movement cease with the capture of Jerusalem. Ten years
later there were Crusaders still going East in answer to Urban’s
call for the First Crusade, while the actual possession of the Holy
City by the Crusaders afforded the necessary impetus for a steady
stream of pilgrims between west and East. With the pilgrim and
the Crusader went also the merchant, courier, minstrel, and adn
venturer. l‘hus wayfaring, with all its attendant good and evil,
became a habit over all of Europe. What this exchange of ideas
and wares meant transcends statistics and must be looked for in
the accelerated progress of Europe which followed, in the so-called
Renaissance of the Twelfth Century.

Quite apart from the Crusade itself‚ the eye- -witness accounts of
the expedition have a peculiar value for the student of history as
the first fairly full description of European society since the fall
of the Roman Empire in the West. It is difficult tofind in the
period between the fifth and twelfth centuries any writings which
describe contemporary life and society. Einhard's Life of Charle-
Μᾶρκε is the striking exception. Just as the meagre Germania
of Tacitus has been remorselessly tortured into a confession of
Germanic civilization, frequently made to serve all centuries from
the prehistoric to the eighth, and even beyond, so Einhard,¹ with
but little help, has been pressed into equally heroic service for
the eighth and ninth centuries. The next two centuries, for lack
of a Tacitus or an Einhard, have been constrained to linger under
the infamy of the name “Dark Ages.” This darkness, however, is
effectively dispelled at the end of the eleventh century, largely
through these chronicles of the First Crusades, while the steadily
swelling volume of writings thereafter obviates the danger for suc· ’
ceeding ages. The religious character of the Crusades drew the
sympathetic attention of clerical writers, the only writers of the

time. All that the leaders did on this journey “of the Lord,”
