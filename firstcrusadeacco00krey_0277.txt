THE FIRST CRUSADE 253

on this side of Ramlah, they encountered a force of four hundred
chosen Arabs and about two hundred Turks. Galdemar, because
of the small number of his men, arranged his knights and bowmen
in the front ranks and, trusting in the Lord, advanced upon the
enemy without hesitation. The enemy, however, thought that they
would be able to crush this band, and, rushing upon them and shoot—
ing arrows‚ they encircled them. Three or four of Galdemar’s
knights were killed, including Achard ot' Montemerle, a noble youth
and renowned knight; others were wounded, and all our bowmen
fell. However, many of the enemy were also killed. Nevertheless,
the attack of the enemy did not slacken on account of all this, nor
did the courage ot* our knights, nay God’s knights, falter; though
oppressed by wounds and death itselt', they stood up to their enemies
all the more fiercely‚ the more they suffered from them. But when
our leaders, rather from weariness than from fear, were about to
withdraw, a cloud of dust was seen approaching. Raymond Piletus
was rushing headlong into the fight with his men. Moreover‚ his

After the pursuit was over our men assembled, divided the spoils,
and then marched to Joppa. The sailors received thern with great
joy and felt so secure after their arrival that they forgot their ships
and neglected to place watches on the sea, but entertained the
crusaders with a feast of bread, wine, and fish from their ships.
The sailors‚ carel'ess of their security, failed to post lookouts for
the night, and in the darkness they were suddenly surrounded by
enemies from the sea. When dawn came, they realized that the
enemy was too strong to be resisted, and they abandoned their
ships, carrying only the spoils. Thus our knights returned to
Jerusalem >after winning one battle and losing another. How-
ever one of our ships which had gone on a plundering expedition
was 'not captured. It was returning to port with the greatest plunder
when it saw the rest of our ships surrounded by so great a fleet of
the enemy. By the use of oars and sail it made its escape to 'Laodi-
caea and told our friends and companions at that port what had
