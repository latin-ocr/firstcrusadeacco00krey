THE FIRST CRUSADE 95

tact in handling men, had commanded that this be done and said
by thern. For, since he was especially expert in penetrating the
secrets of minds and in discovering the disposition of a man, he
very readily understood that Bohemund was of a shrewd and
suspicious nature; and he foresaw what happened. For, lest Bohe—
mund should conceive any suspicion against him, the Emperor had
ordered that raw meats be placed before him, together with the
cooked, thus easily removing suspicion. Neither did his conjec-
ture fail, for the very shrewd Bohemund took the prepared food,
without even touching it with the tips of his fingers‚ or tasting it,
and immediately turned around, concealing, nevertheless, the suspi-
cion which occurred to him by the following ostentatious show of
liberality. For under the pretext of courtesy he distributed all
the food to those standing around; in reality, if one understood
rightly, he was dividing the cup of death among them. Nor did hc
conceal his cunning, so much did he hold his subjects in contempt;
for he this day used the raw meat which had been offered to him
and had it prepared by his own cooks after the manner of his
country. On the next day he asked his men whether they were

never chose the right path; and when anyone deviates from the
moderation of virtue, it makes little difference to whatsoever ex-
treme he goes, for he is always far from honesty.

For the rest, the Emperor then summoned Bohemund and ex-
acted frorn him the usual oath of the Latins. The latter, knowing
well his own resources, and realizing that he was neither of noble
birth nor well supplied by fortune withrwe'alth, *for he had no

⁷ great force, but only a moderate number of Gauls with him, and

being, besides, dishonest in character, readily submitted himself to
the will of the Emperor.

After this, the Emperor saw to it that a room in the palace was
so filled with a collection of riches of all kinds that the very floor
was covered with costly raiment, and with gold and silver coins,
and certain other less valuable things, so much so that one was not
able even to wall< there, so hindered was he by the abundance of
these things. The Emperor ordered the guide suddenly and unex-
