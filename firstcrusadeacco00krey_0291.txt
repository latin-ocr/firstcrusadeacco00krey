111135 Duke Godfrey with his line, and the Count 01 St. (311165 rode
near the sea 011 1116 right side. The 6011111 01 Normandy, 1116 6011111
01 Flanders, Tancred, and all the rest rode in 1116 middle. Then
our men began to move about a little, but the enemy stood ready
101 battle. Each 0116 11311 1115 water-bag hanging from 1115 neck, out
01 which they could drink as they pursued 115, 11111 by the grace 01
God they were not accorded this (privilege). Moreover, the Count
01 Normandy, perceiving that the standard 01 1116 Emis had a kind
01 golden apple on the top 01 3 50631 1111111611 111135 worked with silver,
rushed violently upon him and wounded him even to death. On
another side, the 6011111 01 Flanders very fiercely rushed upon the
enemy. Tancred, thereupon, made a charge through the middle of
their 161115, 31111 when the pagans saw this, they straightway took to
flight. The multitude 01 1116 pagans was innumerable, and 110
0116 knows their number except God alone. The battle was huge,
but accompanying us was the Divine might, so great, so strong, that
we overcame them immediately. Moreover, our enemy stood
blinded and stupefied‚ and, though looking at the knights 01 Christ
with open eyes, they saw nothing; thus terrified at the valor 01 (3011,
they dared not rise up against the Christians. In 1116 excess of
their 1631· they climbed trees, in which they thought to hide them-

into the sea, and others fled hither and hither.

‘Thereupon the Emir, coming in front 01 1116 city, grieving and
sorrowfully weeping‚ said: “O Spirits of the Gods! Who ever
saw or heard such things? Such might, such valor, such military
skill, never exceeded by any people, is now conquered by a band

I am conquered by a race, beggarly‚ unarmed, and very poor, a race
that has nothing except a beggar’s scrip and cloak. They now

pursue the Egyptian people who commonly gave them alms when
in olden times they begged through our whole land. Hither, ac-
cording to agreement, I have brought together two hundred thousand
knights, and, behold, I see them fleeing with 10056 bridles along the
road to Babylon, and they dare not turn back against the Frankish
people! Ι swear by Mohammed and by the names of ’all the gods
