200 THE FIRST CRUSADE

other; thou canst see that the Lord has “iven thee this be-
cause of thy deserts. The Lord commands thee, O Count, to
find out who will be willing to make himself lord of this city over
the others; and to seek from him what kind of dominion he shall
wish to establish for the sake of the Lord. If thou and thy brothers
to whom God gave this city know that he is faithful and wishes to
maintain the justice of God, let him have it. And if he is unwilling
to do and hold justice and judgment, but wishes to keep the city
through his might, do thou alone, and through thy brothers, ask ad-
vice of God, and He will give it thee. And those men who have fol-
lowed the right path, or whom God cherishes, will not fail thee; let
those, however, who are unwilling to keep the right way, turn to
him who is unwilling to execute justice, and it will be seen how God

will save them. For they shall have the same curse from God and
His Mother which Lucifer had when he fell from heaven. And

do you, if you are all of one mind, ask advice in prayer and God ψ

will give it to you. And if there is concord among you, take coun-
sel about a patriarch who is of your law. Moreover, do not loose
those men who have come to you from captivity to keep your law.

He will advise you. Jerusalem is ten days from you, and if you
are not willing to keep the above written commands, you shall not
go into Jerusalem in ten years. And after ten years I will lead back
the infidels in honor, and a hundred of them shall prevail against
a thousand of you. Do you, men of Christ, seek from the Lord the
petition which the apostles sought. And just as He gave it to them,
so also will He now give it to you. You, Count and Bohemund, go
to the church of St. Andrew, and he will give you the best counsel
from God. And that which God shall place in your hearts (to do),
do. And after St. Andrew has visited you, visit him and have your
brothers visit him. Between you, Count and Bohemund, let there
be concord and love of God and neighbor. And if, indeed, you have
fortunately come to agreement, nothing will be able to separate
you, It is well to show first the justice which you ought to main-
tain. According as the men are followers of their individual
bishops, let them profess their wealth; let them aid the poor of
their kind just as they can, and as there shall be need. Moreover,
about other matters do as you shall agree. If any are unwilling to
do this and other justice, constrain them. And if anyone shall wish
