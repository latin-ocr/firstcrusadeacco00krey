likewise took oath that he, together with his army, would come with
us, by land and by sea; that he would afford us faithfully a market
by land and sea, and that he would diligently make good our losses;
in addition, that he did not wish‚ and would not permit, any of our
pilgrims to be disturbed or come to grief on their way 10 1116

(Anna.) But when Bohemund had arrived at Apri with his
companions, realizing both that he was not of noble birth, and that
for lack of money he had not brought with him a large enough
army, he hastened, with only ten Gauls, ahead of the other counts
and arrived at Constantinople. He did this to win the favor 01
1116 Emperor for himself, and to conceal more safely the plans
which he was concocting against him. Indeed, the Emperor, to
whom the schemes 01 1116 111311 were known, for he had long 511166
become acquainted with the hidden and deceitful dealings of this
same Bohemund, took great pains to arrange it so that before the
other counts should come he would speak with him alone. Thus
having heard what Bohemund had to say, he hoped 10 persuade him
to cross before the others came, lest, joined with them after their
coming, he might pervert their minds.

1116 111311, considering him cautiously and carefully and drawing out
what was in his mind. As soon as he saw that Bohemund was ready
to consent to swear an oath 01 fealty to him, he said, “You must
be tired from 1116 journey and should retire to rest. We will talk
tomorrow about anything else.’'

So Bohemund departed to Cosmidion, where hospitality was pre-
pared 101 him, and he found a table richly laden with an abundance
01 food and condiments of all kinds. Then the cooks came and
showed him the uncooked flesh 01 3111111315 and birds, saying: “We
have prepared this food which you see on the table according to our
skill and the custom 01 11115 region; but 11, perchance, these please
you less, here is food, still uncooked, which can be prepared just
