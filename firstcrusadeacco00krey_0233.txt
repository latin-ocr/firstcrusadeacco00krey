THE FIRST CRUSADE 211

yet you could not be secure, since a hundred thousand adversaries
would threaten each one 01 you. Among you is killing and rapine
and theft, no justice, and very much adultery, when it would please
God if you should all take wives, But concerning justice, the Lord
commands thus; that if any one shall do violence to a poor man,
all that is in the house of the oppressors shall be made public
(property). Of the tithes the Lord says that, if you render them,
He Himself is ready to give whatever is necessary. But whenever
you wish to besiege it, he will give you that city out of His com-
passion and not for your deserts; without doubt it will be taken.''

Moreover, when Peter announced this to the Count in the morn-
ing, the Bishops of Orange and Barra assembled the people, and
we made known to 1116111 what has been written. The faithful, thus
led on to the greatest hope of taking the city, offered most generous
alms and prayers to Almighty God to free His poor people for His

to scale (the wall); more followed him and invaded the wall and
some towers of the city. Then night came down which cut off the
battle. The Saracens still retained some towers and a part of the
city. On this account the knights, expecting that the Saracens
would not surrender even in the morning, kept guard outside the
city, lest any should escape. But those to whom life was not very
dear, whom long fasting had led to contempt of self‚ were not
afraid to attack the Saracens amidst the shadows 01 1116 night. And
thus the poor gained both the spoils and 11011565 of 1116 city. More-

few things which they might take 101 themselves. The Saracens,
indeed, concealed themselves in underground caves, and none, or

they searched out the caves with fire and sulphur smoke; and be-
