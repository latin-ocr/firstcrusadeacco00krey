232 THE FIRST CRUSADE

the flames. XVhen he saw that (this man) did not come forth,
thinking that it was Peter Bartholomcw, he began to weep, believ-
ing that he had been destroyed in the fire. There was a multitude
of men there and they could not see everything. And many other
things were revealed to us and done which we do not wish to write
for fear of tiring the readers—since three suitable witnesses are
sufficient for any question. Let us not pass over this one occur-
rence. After Peter Bartholomew had passed through the fise,
though much fire was still burning, yet the people so eagerly gath-
ered brands and coals, together with ashes, that in a short space of
time none of it remained. In the faith of those people the Lord
afterwards worked many good deeds through these relics.

But as Peter came forth from the fire, with his shirt unburned
and with no sign of any hurt on that very fine cloth with which the
Lance of the Lord was wound, all the people welcomed him when
he had signalled to them, holding the Lance in his hand, and had
shouted at the top of his voice, “God help us!'’ They welcomed
him, Ι say, and dragged him along the ground and almost that whole
multitude stepped upon him, each one wishing to touch him, or to
take some piece of his garment, and each one believing him near
someone else. And thus they made three or four wounds on his
legs, cutting off the flesh; and trampling upon his back—bone, they
broke it. And there Peter would have breathed out his soul, as we
believe, had not Raymond Piletus, a most noble and brave knight‚
supported by a crowd of companions, rushed into the mass of the
confused mob and freed him by fighting even to death. But now
from concern and anguish we cannot write more about this.

When Raymond Piletus had brought Peter to our house and his
wounds had been bound up, we asked ‘him why he had stopped in
the fire. To this he rephed, “The Lord met me in the midst of the
flames and, taking me by the hand, said to me, ‘Since thou didst
doubt the finding of the Lance when St. Andrew showed it to thee,
thou shalt not pass through unhurt, but thou shalt not see hell.’ And
having said this, He left me. Look‚ therefore, if you wish, at my
burns.” And there was a slight burn on his legs but not much ; the
wounds, however, were large.

After this we called together all who had doubted the Lance to
come and see his face, head, hair, and other members. They would
find out that what he said of the Lance and other matters was true,
since for proof of these things he had not feared to enter such a
fire. Therefore many looked, and, upon seeing his face and whole
body, they glorified God, saying‚ “Well can the Lord, who delivered
this man from such a flaming fire, protect us amidst the swords of
