THE FIRST CRUSADE 17

tainty. Army rosters were not yet in use. It is, furthermore, ex-
tremely doubtful whether even among the better organized bands,
such as those of Raymond and Godfrey‚ the leaders themselves
knew exactly how many persons were in their following. The
more adventurous knights were constantly digressing in smaller
or larges companies from the main line of march3 the more timid
were dropping behind or deserting; and new enthusiasts were join-
ing the march at almost every halting place. Thus the total number
in the army fluctuated from day to day. Fulcher's statement that
if all who had signed themselves with the cross had been present at
Nicaea, there would have been six million, instead of six hundred
thousand, arnied men is probably more accurate in its proportions
than in its actual figures. A modern estimate of the number in the
army as it left Nicaea, ingeniously computed from the length of
time required to cross a certain bridge in Asia Minor, is 105,000
person& The combined army was then at its maximum size. It
dwindled rapidly 'thereafte13 and the figures offered by the chroni-
clers themselves became more and more accurate, so that when

x Fulcher reports the number of Crusaders left to garrison Jerusalem

as a few hundred, his statement may be accepted without great
question.

If they had so much difficulty in describing their own numbers,
little surprise need be felt at their estimate of the enemy’s forces.
, After chronicling battles against the Turks and Saracens for almost
thirty years, Fulcher reaches the following conclusion: “As to the
number of dead or wounded in this or any other battle, it is not
possible to determine the truth, for such great numbers cannot be
computed by anyone, except approximately. Often when different
writers deceive, the reason for their deception is to be attributed
to adulation; for they try to enhance the glory of the victors and
to extol the valor of their own land for people present and to corne.
From this it is very clear why they so foolishly and falsely exagger-
ate the number of dead among the enemy, and minimize‚ or remain
entirely silent, about their own loss.” This critical attitude, how-
ever, was not taken by the earlier writers, not even by Fulcher
himself in the period with which this translation deals.

4, Money and prices.

Europe was still dealing largely on a basis of natural economy
when the First Crusade started on its way. Money was regarded
rather as a luxury than as a matter of general need, and even
ordinary state obligations were discharged in kind rather than coin.
Indeed, there was no ,standard coin in the west, and coinage was a
