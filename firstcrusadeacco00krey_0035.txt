THE FIRST CRUSADE 19

sorted to almost every conceivable device to obtain it. They tor>-
tured Jews, melted plate, mortgaged their possessions, and sold
their goods for ridiculously small sums. Money, ordinarily scarce,
rose in value until, as Albert recounts‚ one peasant sold seven sheep
for a single denarius. Normally, a denarius was the equivalent of
a workman’s dinner, but the Crusade created abnormal conditions.
Unfortunately, this abnormal state ot' affairs accompanied the
Crusaders along their whole line of: march, for just as their arrange-
ments for departure caused the exchange value of money to soar, so
the arrival of so many people at one town or another caused the
limited food supply to take on incredible prices. Occasionally, in
time of famine, food rose to almost impossible heights, so that the
peasant who exchanged his seven sheep for one denarius in the
Rhine country might have exchanged his denarius, in turn, for a
single nut at Antioch during its siege by Kerbogha. The student of
economics will be able to find many such equations in the following
pages. The Crusaders had unwittingly become steady victims of
the law of supply and demand, but for lack of such knowledge they
blamed their missortunes upon the cupidity of the Armenians and
Greeks. Thus, however, they learned to esteem the possession os
money, and in Saracen territory they lost few opportunities to
secure it either as tribute, extortion, or plain robbery. Sometimes
they even burned the dead bodies of their foes to obtain the coins
which they believed these people had swallowed or secreted about
their bodies. Actual money and its value was one of the most
important contributions of the returning Crusaders to Western
life, so much so that the besam* of Constantinople and the Saracen
besoent became well known coins in Europe.

A definite organization of the army as a whole did not exist. The
Pope’s representative, Adhemar, who met all of his charges at
Nicaea for the first time, was social and ecclesiastical head of the
expedition until his death at Antioch, August Ι, 1098. For military
purposes, the Crusaders chose Stephen of Blois as their leader on
the march across Asia Minor, and, after his withdrawal, Bohemund
acted in that capacity for a time. Little real authority, however,
was accorded these leaders, except for the brief period of Ker-
bogha’s siege, when Bohemund was entrusted with full powers.
Ordinarily‚ matters of policy were decided at a council of all the
leaders, both lay and ecclesiastical. For all practical purposeS, each
band was almost a separate army in itself, and even within each
band matters were usually decided by a common council. Leaders
of the separate bands frequently had to resort to all the arts of
