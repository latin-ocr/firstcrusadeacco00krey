298 NOTES

The Provencal “good clergy‘' would scarcely ,support Arnulf as candidate
for the patriarcha] office.

¹⁸ Matt. 20:1-16.

1²¹ Probably Gaston of Becrt, who has been mentioned before on several
occasions. See page 257. It is uncertain whether he was from northern
or southern France.

2⁰ Arnulf of Martirano‚ whose death Raymond has already described.

21Daimbert, or Dagobert‚ Archbishop of Pisa, who here enters the his-
tory of the Cmsade, had become prominent in the affairs of the Western
Church. He had been ordained by the anti-pope, Wibert of Ravenna, but
shortly thereafter was won over to the side of Urban. He became Bishop
of Pisa, and when Corsica was acquired from the Saracens, Urban added
Corsica to the diocese of Pisa and elevated the episcopal see to an arch-
bishopric. Daimbert thus became the first Archbishop of Pisa. He was
entrusted by Urban with several commissions to various provinces, and in
1098 he took the leadership in organizing a naval expedition to go on the
Crusade. Needless to say, Urban approved of this and may have sent
Daimbert as his vicar to succeed Adhemar‚ who had died at Antioch. At any
rate, on his arrival in the East Daimbert found himself the leading church-
man there, and the only one who by intimate acquaintance was qualified to
represent the Pope. Bohemund, whose hold upon Antioch was jeopardized
by the claims of Alexius, was anxious for the approval of the Pope as a
lever to turn the energy of the Crusaders against Alexius. His immediate
friendship for Daimbert, the friend of the Pope, plays an important part
in later events.

22 Sugar-cane. The crusaders introduced it widely in the west.

2³ Psalms 132: 7.

24Psa1ms 122z4.

2⁵ Lake of Gennesaret, or Sea of Galilee.

26Α glance at the map will show that Fulcher’s identification of Balbec
with Thadamar is impossible. He undoubtedly saw Balbec and had read
about Thadamar‚ which was once a fiourishing trading centre, but it is doubt-
ful whether more than the magnificent ruins of the latter place were then in
evidence. Fulcher probably never saw even the site of Palmyra, or Thada-
mar‚ but applied his learning to embellish his description of Balbec. Thada-
mar was scarcely on the road from Jerusalem to Laodicaea.

2⁷ Both Roberts returned home with their armies. Robert of Normandy
tarried sometime at Salerno to be healed of a troublesome wound which he
had received on the Crusade. When he reached Normandy, he found his
brother, William Rufus, dead, and his younger brother, Henry‚ on the Eng-
lish throne. A quarrel finally broke out between himself and Henry‚ and in
the war which followed Robert was captured and forced to spend his last
days as ·a prisoner. He died in 1126. 'Robert of Flanders probably bore his
letter to the Pope at Rome and then hastened home. During the next eleven
years he figured prominently in feudal warfare, though not always to his
credit. His chief claim to farne lies in his exploits as a Crusader. He died
in 1111.
