20 THE FIRST CRUSADE

persuasion at their command in order to keep their many-minded
and impulsive vassals in leash. Eloquence, entreaty, offers of pay,
and even threats were used time and time again. The feudal oath
of allegiance of vassal to over-lord was the only basis of obedience,
but the conditions under which the campaign was conducted were
so different from those of the west as to render the ordinary
feudal obligations quite inadequate. As a result, adventurous
knights frequently went off on raiding expeditions without regard
for the wishes of their lords, and companies of knights for these
forays were formed from many different bands, Disorganization
was further increased by the presence of great numbers of non-.
combatants. Persons of both sexes and all ages had attached them-
selves to the army from various motives—serfs to perform menial
tasks; peasants with their families seeking improvement, material,
social, or spiritual; women, wives of Crusaclers, or mere adven-
turers; pious pilgrims of all ages; and clergy, both regular and
secular. At Nicaea this multitude probably largely outnumbered the
fighting men, and, as a rule, they were a great hindrance to the army.

The fighting men were of two classes—the mounted and armored
knight, and the more or less armored foot-soldiers. At first the
mounted knights were probably all of noble birth, but, as the exigen-
cies of the campaign multiplied, this condition was changed. At
times noble knights were compelled to ride on oxen or other
beasts, or to proceed on foot, and, again, ignoble foot-soldiers found
mounts and suits of armor. In the course of time, many of the
latter proved themselves worthy of knighthood, so that by the time
, the army reached Jerusalem a great number of the so-called knights
were not of noble birth.

The knight, protected by his breastplate and his suit of chain-
mail, and equipped with shield, lance, and two-edged sword‚ was
the mainstay of the army. His squires, also mounted, usually ac-
companied the knight in battle. The foot-soldiers‚ whose chief
weapons were the cross-bow and javelin, were used both to break
up the line of the enemy in the opening charge and to dispose of
the dismounted enemy after the main charge of the knights. Non-
combatants were of some service in refreshing the fighters with
drinks, caring for the wounded‚ and helping to collect the spoils.
The clergy played an important part by administering the sacra-
ment before battle and offering up prayers during the course of the
fighting. Such was the practice against an enemy in the open field.
The tactics of the Turks‚ however, caused some modifications.
This foe, usually mounted on swift horses and armed with danger-
ous small bows, insisted upon encircling the Crusaders without
coming to close quarters. Their arrows, which they shot quickly
