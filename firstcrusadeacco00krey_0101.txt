THE FIRST CRUSADE 83

Emperor brought over on the ships) rushed upon them from all
sides with arrows and fiercely attacked them. Baldwin, unable to
resist from the bridge, hastened to escape their arrows by going
across the bridge. Along the dry shore he swiftly betook himself
to the other side of the bridge, (hoping) to hold it and keep watch
upon the walls of the lord and master of the city while the entire
army passed over that bridge, and the Duke with his men kept
guard from the rear. In the meantime, from the gates opposite
St. Argyenteus an infinite band of Turcopoles and soldiers of every
kind, equipped with bows and arms of every description, ran for-
ward to attack Baldwin and the whole band of Christian people.
But in the appointed place Baldwin, immovable and unconquered,
withstood their every attack from early morning even to vespers‚
until the people were taken across the bridge and lodged in the
camps placed before the walls of the city. Baldwin, with his five

Then the Duke arrived and, since it was night, brought an end to

more and more violent, and that his soldiers would fail and perish
in the darkness of evening, commanded peace to be made, rejoicing
that the Duke had been willing to withdraw his army from battle.

But after sunrise the next day, the people, surging forth at the ,ι s
command of the Duke, wandered about plundering the lands and f
kingdom of the Emperor for six days, so that, to say the least, the (st
pride of the Emperor and his men seemed to be humbled. When Γ
this became known, the Emperor began to grieve and lament because
his lands and kingdom were being thus devastated. Taking coun-
sel immediately, he sent a message to the Duke to the effect that he
should prohibit plunder and fire, and that he himself would give
satisfaction in every respect to the Duke. The message ran as fol-
lows: “Let enmity between you and us cease. Let the Duke,
upon receiving hostages as a pledge from me, advance without any
doubt that he will come and return unharmed, assured of all the
