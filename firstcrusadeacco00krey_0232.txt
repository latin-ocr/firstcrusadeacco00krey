210 THE FIRST CRUSADE

Peter and Andrew, through whom we should both learn His will
and be able to satisfy His stern will towards us. Accordingly, they
came into the chapel ot* the Count about midnight and aroused Peter
to whom they had recently shown the Lance. When he then sud-
denly saw them clothed in ill-shapen garb, standing near the chest
where the relies were, he believed them to be some paupers who
wanted to steal something from the tent. For there was St. Andrew,
dressed in an old shirt torn at the shoulders and in a cloak ripped
at the opening of his left shoulder; there was nothing over the
right shoulder and he was vilely shod. Peter wore only a coarse
and long shirt down to his ankles.

Then Peter Bartholomew said to them, “Who are you, Sirs?
What do you want ?'’

And St. Peter replied, “We are envoys of God. I am Peter, ano
this is Andrew, But we wished to appear to thee in this garb, in
order that thou shouldst see how much it profiteth to serve God
devoutly. In this season and garb, as thou seest us, we came tc
God, and such we now are.’'

And at this word nothing was brighter than they, nothing more
beautiful. Peter, indeed, who saw this, terrified at the bright light,
fell to the earth as if dead, and, sweating from excessive anguish,
he moistened the earth upon which he had fallen. Then St. Peter
raised him and said to him, “Thou didst fall easily.’'

And he replied, “It is so, Lord.”

Again St. Peter (spoke): “So fall all who are in unbelief‚ or
who transgress the commands of God. But if they are penitent for
their evil deeds, and call out to God, the Lord raises them just as I
raised thee when thou hadst fallen. And just as thy sweat remains
on the ground, so God will take up and bear away the sins of those
who cry out to Him. Tell me, how is the army ?'’

And he replied, “Indeed, Sire, they are in great sear of hunger
and all wretchedness.'’

And then St. Peter said: “And verily can they be in great sear
who had deserted Almighty God! They do not remember the
dangers from which He rescued them to give Him any thanks. For
when you were all beaten and humbled at Antioch, you cried out to
the Lord so that we who were in heaven heard. The Lord heeded
you and gave you His Lance as a token of victory ; then He caused
you miraculously and gloriously to triumph over your enemies who
besieged you. And now to which Lord do you entrust your safety,
you who have gravely offended God? Will the high mountains or
the caves protect you? For even if you should be on a very high
and strong place and have abundance of all the necessaries of life,
