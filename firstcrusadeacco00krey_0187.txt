Curbara said to him: “I recognize you as so honorable and wise
that I will fully consent to whatever good you wish to d0.” And
thereupon Curbara returned to his army.

Forthwith the Turks, making sport of the gatherings of Franks,
brought into the presence of Cztrba-ra a certain very miserable sword
covered with rust, a very worn wooden bow, and an exceedingly
useless lance, which they had just recently taken from poor pilgrims,
and said, “Behold the arms which the Franks carry to meet us in
battle!’' Then Curbai'a began to laugh, saying before all who were
in that gathering, “These are the warlike and shining arms which the
Christians have brought against us into Asia, with which they hope
and expect to drive us beyond the confines of Chorosan and to wipe
out our names beyond the Amazon rivers, they who have driven our
relatives from Romania and the royal city of Antioch, which is the
renowned capital of all Syria!'' Then he summoned his scribe and

Wise, I hold all of them now in my hand. I shall make them either
undergo sentence of death, or be led into Chorosan into the harshest
captivity, because they are threatening with their arms to drive us
forth and to expel us from all our territory, or to cast us out beyond
upper India, as they have cast out all our kinsmen from Romania or
Syria. Now Ι swear to you by Mohammed and all the names of the
gods² that Ι will not return ‘before your face until Ι shall have
acquired with my strong right hand the regal city of Antioch, all
³ Syria, Romania, and Bulgaria, even to Apulia, to the honor of the
