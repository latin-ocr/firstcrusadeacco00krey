THE FIRST CRUSADE 91

himself. So he very freely granted their request, but when they
had been placed on ship, he took them by sea to the Sepulchre of
the Lord, the very thing which they especially sought. He like-
wise sent messages to those counts who were even then expected
and held forth words of good-will, bidding them expect every good;
and so, when they carne to Constantinople, they did with alacrity
all that was demanded of them. But so much for Count Raoul.

Following the latter closely came an innumerable multitude gath-
ered from almost all the provinces and lands of Gaul, together with
the kings, dukes, counts, and even bishops, who led them. The
Emperor sent his men out to meet them and received them with
words full of grace, for he was conspicuous for his foresight of
what was to happen and for seizing with dexterity upon the means
useful for the occasion. In addition, he bade men appointed for
this purpose see that there was an abundance of food-stuffs and
needed articles ready everywhere for the coming armies, lest any
occasion, or pretext, be afforded them for venturing upon any hos-

stantinople, one might have likened them to the stars of the sky,
or to the sands which have been cast up on shores of the sea. Truly,
as Homer said, there were as many heads of men as there are leaves
and fiowers that fall in the autumn. All these were hastening to
reach the city of Constantine. Nay, even though I desire to report
the names of their leaders themselves, Ι cannot bring them to mind
to set down; for my tongue becomes dumb, partly at the barbarous

of them. But what would be gained by taking the trouble to write
the names of such a multitude, the very sight of whom wearied
those who were there?

The armies which reached the city at the same time were located
by the Emperor’s command near the monastery of Cosmidion, the
camp extending so widely that it touched the Temple itself. Not
nine heralds restrained this throng by shouting‚ as in ancient times
they restrained the Greeks, but valiant sturdy knights, who fol-
lowed the multitude of Latins in sufficient number, gave ample as-
surance that they would heed the commands of the Emperor. He
desired them to subscribe to the same oath by which Godfrey had
bound himself and called them before him, one by one, to discuss
with them separately what he wished. Those whom he found more
amenable he used as intercessors in overcoming the reluctance of
the more obstinate. Nevertheless, since those who were awaiting
the impending arrival of Bohemund were not won over, but were
