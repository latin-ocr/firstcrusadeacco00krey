36 THE FIRST CRUSADE

sear God want nothing, nor those who cherish Him in truth. The
possessions of the enemy, too, will be yours, since you will make
spoil of their treasures and return victorious to your own; or em-
purpled with your own blood, you will have gained everlasting
glory. For such a Commander you ought to fight, for One who
lacksneither might nor wealth with which to reward you. Short is
the way, little the labor, which, nevertheless‚ will repay you with
the crown that fadeth not away. Accordingly, we speak with the
authority of the prophet: ‘Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O
mighty one.’²⁵ Gird yourselveS, everyone of you, Ι say, and be
valiant sons; for it is better for you to die in battle than to behold
the sorrows of your race and of your holy places. Let neither
property nor the alluring charnis of your wives entice you from
going; nor let the trials that are to be borne so deter you that you
remain here.''

And turning to the bishops, he said, “You, brothers and fellow
bishops; you, fellow priests and sharers with us in Christ, make
this same announcement through the churches committed to you,
and with your whole soul vigorously preach the journey to Jerusa-

secure in Christ, grant them speedy pardon. Moreover, you who
are to go shall have us praying for you; we shall have you fighting
for God’s people. It is our duty to pray‚ yours to fight against the
Amalekites.2⁶ With Moses, we shall extend unwearied hands in
prayer to Heaven, while you go forth and brandish the sword, like
dauntless warriors, against Amalek.'’

As those present were thus clearly informed by these and other
words of this kind from the apostolic lord, the eyes of some were
bathed in tears; some trembled‚ and yet others discussed the matter.
However‚ in the 'presence of all at that same council, and as we
looked on, the Bishop of Puy,²⁷ a man of great renown and of
highest ability, went to the Pope with joyful countenance and on
bended knee sought and entreated blessing and permission to go.
Over and above this, he won from the Pope the command that all
should obey him, and that he should ,hold sway over all the army
in behalf of the Pope, since all knew him to be a prelate of unusual
energy and industry. . . .

(Guibert of Noyent.) . . . “If among the churches scattered
about over the whole world some, because of persons or location,
deserve reverence above others (for persons, I say, since greater
privileges are accorded to apostolic sees; for places, indeed, since
the same dignity which is accorded to persons is also shown to
regal cities, such as Constantinople), we owe most to that church
