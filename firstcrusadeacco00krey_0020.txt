these experiences. Itis this quality which causes the chronicles
themselves to be read with interest long after their material has been
adorned with finer language by more skilful writers.

But the absence of a polished literary finish was not wholly due
to a lack of skill on the part ot' the writers. It was partly due, also,
to the fact that these writings were intended for the information
of the contemporary world. They were the newspapers of the time
and in this they marl< a distinct advance in the art of disseminating
current information. Hitherto, writing had been almost exclusively
confined to the Latin language and, hence, to churchmen, The few
exceptions in vernacular tongues before the twelfth century have
been deservedly treasured as rare monuments of philology. In the
Latin writings only such matters as were of interest to the clergy
were accorded much consideration. Theological writings, Scripture,
the writings of the Church Fathers, books of Church service, text-
books for the schools‚ and treatises on kindred subjects constituted
the chief themes for writers. Laws of kingdoms and meagre entries
in monastic annals composed the major portion of secular informa-
tion committed to writing. Occasionally the career of some ruler
was chronicled in panegyric fashion‚ usually because of some past or
expected favor to the Church. Even the histories of nations—e.g.,
lee History of tlte Franks by Gregory of Tours, or lee Ecclesiasti-
cal History of Enqlcmd by the Venerable Bede— were ecclesiastical
histories, in which the purely secular played but an incidental part.

The written description of contemporary events for contem-
porary men was left to letters. But in the narrow life of the time
people were rarely so far removed from their friends that they
found it necessary to resort to such means for exchanging informa-
tion. The churchmen, whose organization radiated from Rome,
and whose training had made them more familiar with the art of
writing, alone employed letters to any great extent. Here again.
however, ecclesiastical and scholastic matters received the pre-
ponderant share of attention, though often current bits of general
interest were included. These latter items might be transmitted to
Church gatherings and, doubtless, were frequently so treated. But
for the most part the news of the day was passed orally from
neighbor to neighbor, or wider areas were momentarily linked
together by the tales of some warfaring minstrel or other traveller.
As the monasteries and castles were most famous for their hos-
pitality‚ so these were the best informed centers of -the time.

The Crusade, however, created abnormal conditions. Most of
