to delay peacefully in his kingdom, with license to buy the neces-
saries of life, until he should have as his companion Peter the
Hermit, upon whose admonition and persuasion he had begun this
journey. And he also begged that, when the troops were united,
they might cross in ships over the arm ot' the sea called the Strait
of St. George, and thus they would be able to resist more safely
the squadrons of the Turks and the Gentiles. The outcome was
that the requests made of the Lord Emperor, Alexius by name,
were granted.

Not long after these eventS, Peter and his large army, innumer-
able as the sands of the sea—-an army which he had brought to—
gether from the various realms of the nations of the Franks, Swa-
bians, Bavarians, and Lotharingians—were making their way to
Jerusalem. Descending on that march into the kingdom of Hun-
gary‚ he and his army pitched their tents before the gate ot' Oeden-
burg. . . .

Peter heard this report and, because the Hungarians and Bul-

to withstand the strength of the Gauls. Godfrey‚ surnamed Burel—
a native of the city Etampes‚ master and standard-bearer of two
hundred foot—soldiers, himself a foot-soldier, and a man of great
strength—seeing the ssight of the Hungarians away from the walls,
then quickly crossed over the walls by means of a ladder he chanced
to find there. Reinald of Broyes, a distinguished knight, clad in
helmet and coat os mail, ascended just after Godfrey; soon all the
knights, as well as the foot-soldiers‚ hastened to enter the city. The
Hungarians, seeing their own imminent peril, gathered seven thou—
sand strong for defense; and, having passed out through another
gate which looked toward the east, they stationed themselves on the
summit of a lofty cmg, beyond which flowed the Danube, where
they were invincibly fortified. A very large part of these were
