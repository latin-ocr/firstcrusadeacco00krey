THE FIRST CRUSADE 27

any disposition or crookedness contrary to God-’s law, because you
have lost the moderation of reason and justice, Ι shall earnestly en-
deavor to correct it at once, with divine assistance. For the Lord
has made you stewards over His family, that you provide it with
pleasant-tasting meat in season. You will be blessed, indeed, if the
Lord shall find you faithful in stewardship. Yon are also called
shepherds; see that you do not the work of hirelings. Be true
shepherds and have your crooks always in your hands„ Sleep not,
but defend everywhere the flock committed to your care. For if
through your carelessness or neglect the wolf carries off a sheep,
doubtless you will not only lose the reward prepared for you by
our Lord, but, after having first been tortured by the strokes of the
lictor, you will also be savagely hurled into the abode of the damned.
In the words of the gospel, ‘Ye are the salt of the earth'?⁹ But, it
is asked, ‘If ye fail, wherewith shall it be salted ?' Oh, what a salt-
ing! Indeed, you must strive by the salt of your wisdom to correct
this foolish people, over-eager for the pleasures of the world, lest
the Lord find them insipid and rank, corrupted by crimes at the
time when He wishes to speak to them. For if because of your
slothful performance of duty He shall discover any worms in them,
that is to say any sins, He will in contempt order them to be cast
forthwith into the abyss of uncleanness; and because you will be
unable to make good to Him such a loss, He will surely banish you,
condemned by His judgment, from the presence of His love. But
one that salteth ought to be prudent, foresighted, learned, peaceful,
watchful, respectable, pious, just, fair-minded, pure. For how can
the unlearned make others learned, the immodest make others mod-
est, the unclean make others clean? How can he make peace who
hates it? If anyone has soiled hands, how can he cleanse the spots
from one contaminated? For it is written, ‘If the blind lead the
blind, both shall fall into the pit.'1⁰ Accordingly, first correct your-
selves, so that without reproach you can then correct those under
your care. If, indeed, you wish to be the friends of God, do gener-
ously what you see is pleasing to Him.

“See to it that the affairs of Holy Church‚ especially, are main-
tained in their rights, and that simoniacal heresy in no way takes
root among you. Take care lest purchasers and venders alike,
struck by the lash of the Lord, be disgracefully driven through nar-
row ways into utter confusion. Keep the Church in all its orders
entirely free from the secular p-ower; have given to God faithfully
one-tenth of the fruits of the earth, neither selling them, nor with-
holding them. Whoever lays violent hands on a bishop‚ let him be
considered excommunicated. Whoever shall have seized monks, or
