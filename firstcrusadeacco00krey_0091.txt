THE FIRST CRUSADE 75

But all the armed men, to the number of 25,0oo foot-soldiers and
500 knights in armor, pressed on their way together toward Nicaea,
in order to avenge their brethren by provoking Soliman and the rest
of the Turks to engage in battle. And so, divided and arrayed in
six battle lines, with standards uplifted in each, they advanced on
the right and on the left.

Boasting and shouting with vehement tumult and great clamor,
they had scarcely advanced through the aforesaid forest and moun-
tain region three miles from the port of Civitote, their halting place,
(Peter being absent and unaware of all this), when lo! Soliman,
with all his intolerable following, entered that same forest from the
opposite side. He was coming down from the city of Nicaea to
fall suddenly upon the Gauls in camp, intending at the point of the
sword to wipe out and destroy them, unaware and unprepared.
Upon hearing the approach and the violent outcry of the Chris-
tians‚ he marvelled greatly what this tumult meant, for all that
the Christians had decided was unknown to him. Finding out
straightway that they were pilgrims‚ 5011111311 addressed his men
as follows: “Behold the Franks, against whom we were marching,
are at hand. Let us withdraw from the forest and the mountains
into the open plain, where we may freely engage in battle with them,
and they can find 110 refuge.'’ Accordingly, this was done without

from the forest and the mountains.

But the Franks, unaware of Soliman’s approach, advanced from
the forest and the mountains with shouting and loud clamor. There
they first beheld the battle lines of Soliman in the midst of the field,
awaiting them for battle. When they had seen the Turks, they
began to encourage one another in the name of the Lord. . . .

There Walter the Penniless fell, pierced by seven arrows which
had penetrated his coat of mail. Reinald 01 Broyes and Folker 01
Chartres, men 01 the greatest renown in their own lands, fell in like
martyrdom, destroyed by the enemy, though not without great
slaughter of the Turks. But Walter of Breteuil, son of Waler-
amnus, and Godfrey Burel, master of the foot-soldiers‚ having
slipped away in flight through briars and thickets, turned back
along the narrow path where the entire band, withdrawn from bat-
tle, had gathered together. When the ssight and desertion of these
men became known, all turned in flight, hastening their course
towards Civitote along the same route by which they had come, but
with little defense against the enemy.

And so the Turks, rejoicing in the pleasing success of victory,
were destroying the wretched band of pilgrims, whom they followed
