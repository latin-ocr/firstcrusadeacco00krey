274 THE FIRST CRUSADE

When we reached there, our long fatigue was forgotten. When
we viewed the much longed for Holy of Holies, we were filled with
joy indescribable. Oh, how often we recalled to mind that prophecy
of David which says, “We shall worship in the place where His
feet have 5’[()Ο(11”23 We beheld that prophecy truly t'ulfilled in us,
although it likewise pertains to many others. Thither, indeed, did
we go up, “the tribes, the tribes of the Lord, to confess His name”²‘¹
in His holy place. On the day of our entrance into Jerusalem, the
retreating sun, having fulfilled its winter descent, resumed its as-
cending course.

After we had visited the Lord’s Sepulchre and His Glorious
Temple and many other sacred places, on the fourth day we went
to Bethlehem, in order that, as we were about to celebrate the anni-
versary of the nativity of our Lord, we might that very night be
watchers in the stable where the Holy Mother laid Jesus, and there
assist in the devotions. All that night we filled with appropriate
devotions; and in the third hour, after three masses had been cele-
brated, we returned to Jerusalem. Oh, what a stench there then was
around the wall of the city, inside and outside, from the dead bodies
of the Saracens, massacred by our colleagues on the capture of the
city, wherever they had hunted them down!

But after we and our beasts had been refreshed for some time
with a much needed rest, and after the Duke and other leaders had
chosen Daimbert, mentioned above, as Patriarch in the church of
the Holy Sepulchre, we got new supplies ot' provisions, and, loading
our mules, we went down again to the river Jordan. Some of
the army, the last to arrive, chose to remain in Jerusale1n; others
who had come first preferred to go with us; but Duke Godfrey
continued energetically to rule the territory of Jerusalem.

On the third day, before the Ides of August, those sickly days,
Urban, Pontiff of Rome, passed away.

On the first day of January 1100 AD. we all took palm branches,
cut in Jerieho, to carry them off, as was customary. On the second
day we commenced our return journey. Our leaders wished to cross
through the city of Tiberias on the sea of Galilee. This sea, formed
from a union of fresh waters, is eighteen miles long and five wide.
We went from there to Caesarea-Philippi, which in the Syrian
tongue is called Paneas, and which is situated at the foot of Mount
Lebanon. There two springs gush forth which give rise to the river
Jordan. This Jordan, flowing through the Sea of Galilee, then
runs into the Dead Sea. The Lake of Gennesaret,2⁵ according to
Josephus, is forty stades wide and one hundred long. The river,
then, flowing in one charmel, spreads out into a sea which is called
