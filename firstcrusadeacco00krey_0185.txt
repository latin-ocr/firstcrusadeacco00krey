CHAPTER V.

KERBOGHA AND THE FINDING or THE LANCE.

(When the 'Crusaders entered Syria, the Mohammedans whom they dis-
possessed fled as refugees to Bagdad. Their pitiable flight and their pleas
moved the Caliph deeply. He sent a personal embassy to the warring Sul-
tans begging them to unite against the common foe, but they did not heed
him. Many of the lesser Turkish princes did respond, however, and a con-
siderable army was brought together, which the Caliph placed in charge of
Kerbogha as general. Kerbogha wasted three whole weeks before Edessa
and then moved on to Antioch, which he reached just as the Crusaders had
entered it—two days too late. The whole First Crusade forms an unpleasant
chapter in Saracen history, one which their historians do not love to describe.
They did not treat of it at length until the more favorable turn of events
under Nured-din and Saladin affords them the opportunity of contrasting
the period with the happier conditions of their own times. Hence, eye-witness
accounts of the First ·Crusade by Mohammedan writers do not exist. Later
Mohammedan authors have charged Kerbogha with incapacity and ill treat-
ment of his subordinate Officers as an explanation of his failure to relieve
Antioch and destroy the Christian army. However‚ Baldwin's fortunate
presence at Edessa, which served to delay Kerbogha‚ and the astonishing
‚ discovery of the Holy Lance, with its marvelous‘e‘fffect upon the discouraged
Latins in Antioch, must be counted as no mean factors in that result. It isk*
interesting to note the practically unanimous belief of the writers and Cru-
saders in the Lance at this time).

Ι. Kerboyha lays sieye to tlte Crusaders in Antioch. (June 5,
1098).

(Gesta). Some time before, Cassianus, Emir of Antioch, had sent
a message to Curbara, chief of the Sultan of Persia, while he was
still at Chorosan‚ to come and help him while there was yet time,
because a very mighty host of Franks was besieging him shut up
in Antioch. If the Emir would aid him, he (Cassianus) would give
him Antioch, or would enrich him with a very great gift. Since
Curbara had had a very large army of Turks collected for a long
time, and had received permission from the Caliph, their Pope, to
kill the Christians‚ he began a long march to Antioch. The Emir of
Jerusalem came to his aid with an army, and the King of Damascus
arrived there with a very large host. Indeed, Curbara likewise
collected countless pagan folk, Turks, Arabs, saracems, Publicani,
Azimites‚1 Kurds‚ Persians, Ayulani and countless other peoples.
