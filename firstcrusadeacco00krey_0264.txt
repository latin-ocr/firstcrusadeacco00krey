CHAPTER VH

THE CAPTURE or JERUSALEM

(The last quarrel between the leaders at Archas apparently cleared the
minds of all. Their attitude thereafter seemed one of grim determination to
fulfil their vow as quickly as possible. The description of the siege and the
capture of Jerusalem offers very graphic testimony as to the degree of
civilization attained by eleventh century Europe. With Jerusalem in their
possession, the ¹Crusaders were still threatened by the vacillating ruler of
Egypt, or Babylon, as they called it. Jerusalem had been surrendered to
the Saracens of Egypt by its Seljuk rulers when the Crusaders were at
Antioch. The inability of the Caliph to send an army to the relief οἱ the
city while it was being besieged is sufficient evidence of his weakness. The
ease with which the Crusaders disposed of Al-Afdhal’s host, while it con-
firms this weakness, also affords eloquent testimony to the prestige which
Western courage and skill had won among the Mohammedans.)

win the war which the Emir of Babylon was getting ready against
them and could take Jerusalem, he would become a Christian and
would recognize his land as (a gift) from¹ them. In such manner
it was settled.

XsVe left the city on the second day of the week in the month
of May and, passing along a narrow and diffi‘cult road all day
and night, we came to a fortresS, the name of which was
Botroun. Then we came to a city called Gibilet near the sea, in
which we suffered very great thirst‚ and, thus worn out, we reached
a river named Ibrahim. Then on the eve of the day of the Ascen-
sion of the Lord we crossed a mountain in which the way was ex-
ceedingly narrow, and there we expected to find the enemy lying
in anibush for us. But God favoring uS, none of them dared to
