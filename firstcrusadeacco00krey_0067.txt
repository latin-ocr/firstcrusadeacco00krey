THE FIRST CRUSADE 51

unable to escape quickly through the narrow passage, and they fell
before the gate. Some who hoped to find refuge on the top of
the mountain were cut down by the pursuing pilgrims; still others,
thrown headlong from the summit of the mountain, were buried
in the waves ot' the Danube, but many escaped by boat. About
four thousand Hungarians fell there, but only a hundred pilgrims‚
not counting the wounded‚ were killed at that same place.

This victory won, Peter remained with all his followers in the
same citadel five days, for he found there an abundance of grain,
flocks of sheep, herds of cattle, a plentiful supply of wine, and an
infinite number of horses. . . .

When Peter learned of the wrath of the King and his very form-
idable gathering of troops, he deserted Malevilla with all his follow-
ers and planned to cross the Morava with all spoils and flocks and
herds of horses. But on the whole bank he found very few boats,
only one hundred and fifty, in which the great multitude must pass
quickly over and escape, lest the King should overtake them with
a great force. Hence many who were unable to cross in boats tried
to cross on rafts made by fastening poles together with twigs. But
driven hither and thither in these rafts without rudders‚ and at
times separated from their companions, many perished‚ pierced with
arrows from the bows of the Patzinaks, who inhabited Bulgaria.
As Peter saw the drowning and destruction which was befalling his
men, he commanded the Bavarians, the Alemanni, and the other
Teutons, by their promise of obedience to come to the aid of their
Frankish brethren. They were carried to that place by seven rafts;
then they sank seven small boats of the Patzinaks with their oc-
, cupants, but took only seven men captive. They led these seven

captives into the presence of ¹Peter and killed them by his order.

When he had thus avenged his men, Peter crossed the Morava
river and entered the large and spacious forests of the Bulgarians
with supplies of food, with every necessary, and with the spoils

from Belgrade. Andafter a delay of eight days in those vast ·

woods and pastures, he and his followers approached Nish, a city
very strongly fortified with walls. After crossing the river before
the city by a stone bridge, they occupied the field, pleasing in its
verdure and extent, and pitched their tents on the banks of the river.

Peter, obedient to the mandate of the Emperor, advanced from
the city of Sofia and withdrew with all his people to the city Philip-
popolis. When he had related the entire story of his misfortune
in the hearing of all the Greek citizens, he received, in the name of
Jesus and in sear of God, very many gifts for him. N ext, the third
