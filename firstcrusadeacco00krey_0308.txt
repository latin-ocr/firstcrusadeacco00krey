NOTES TO PROLOGUE AND CHAPTER I

¹ The Maccabees were followers of Judas Maccabeus, whose exploits are
described in the Book of Maccabees. The name recurs frequently in the
accounts of the First Crusade. The deeds of the Maccabees, recalled by
Urban in his speech at Clermont, served as a heroic model for emulation by
the Crusaders. It is interesting to note the opinions of the different chroni-
clers as to the success of the Crusaders in this aim.

2This is an interesting example of geographical terminology. These
names were not used to designate those particular regions in the mediaeval
period, but were all drawn from Fulcher‘s store οἱ ancient and chiefly Bib-
lical knowledge. His use of the terms must be regarded as a rhetorical
device.

3 Psalms 33: 12.

Clermont see article by D. C. Munro in the American Historical Review for
January, 1906.

⁵Though Henry had been crowned King of Germany in 1054, he did not
receive the imperial crown until 1084, after he had driven Gregory VII from
Rome and installed the antipope‚ Clement III. Under the circumstances,
no loyal adherent of Gregory’s could recognize Henry as rightt'ul Emperor.
Furthermore, Conrad of Franconia was disputing the imperial claims at this
time.

6Urban ΙΙ, formerly Odo, Otho, or Odoard of Largny, or Lagny, in the
neighborhood of Rheims‚ was of noble birth. He entered the service of the
Church and had risen to the rank of archdeacon in its secular hierarchy
when he decided to attach himself to the monastery at Cluny. Here his
learning and zeal for reform won him recognition and he was made prior.
In 1078 Gregory made him Cardinal-Bishop of Ostia. Gregory esteemed
him very highly and in 1084 sent him as envoy to Henry IV, who imprisoned
him for a short time on account of his loyalty to the Pope. Just before
Gregory's death, his name *was mentioned as one of four men whom Greg-
ory regarded as qualified to carry on his policies. The Abbot οἱ Monte
Cassino, who took the title Victor ΙΙΙ, was chosen first, but upon his early
death in 1087, Odo was elected, and in 1088 he was consecrated Pope Urban
II. He carried on the fight with Henry IV throughout the eleven years of
his pontificate. Usually in exile from Rome, he found the struggle at first
very discouraging. The Normans of southern Italy remained true to him,
however, and so also did Matilda of Tuscany. Gradually he gained other
support, and after the Crusaders started on the journey he was enabled,
