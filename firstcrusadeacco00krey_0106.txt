88 THE FIRST CRUSADE

but, clothed in royal raiment, 116 seated himself upon the imperial
throne, as though secure. Thus, on the one hand, he reassured all,
injecting courage into their hearts by his happy look, and, on the
other, he discussed with his advisers and military leaders plans for
coming events. First of all, he absolutely refused to have any
armed band led outside of the walls against the Latins, this for a
twofold reason: First, because this was the most sacred of days,
for it was Friday of the greatest, of Holy‚ Woek, when the Saviour
had undergone ignominious death for all. In the second place, he
refused to engage in civil war between Christians. Therefore, by
means of frequent messengers to the Latins he wished to bring
about the cessation of the undertaking which they had begun, say-
ing: “Remember that on this day there died for us the Lord, who
for the sake of our salvation did not fear to endure the crOSS, nails
and the lance, punishments befitting criminals. But if your desire
for a fight is so great, we, too, will stand ready after the coming
day of the Lord’s resurrection.''

But the Latins were so far from yielding to him that they closed
their ranks and threw missles in such profusion that they struck
across the chest one of the men standing near the Emperor's throne-
At the sight of this, most of those who were standing near fell back,
here and there, from the Emperor, while he, meanwhile, remained
on his throne, not only without any sign of fear, but likewise re-
assuring them and chiding thern greatly for their fear. All ad-

Finally, when he saw that the Latins, 11161611 01 311 51131116, were
invading the walls of the city and scorning his useful counsel,
he first summoned his son-in-law, Nicephorus‚¹³ and commanded
him to take with him the strongest men and those skilled in shoot-
ing arrows and go to the top of the wall. He advised him, at the
same time, to hurl down weapons on the Latins as frequently as
possible, but, for 1116 111051 part, harmlessly, with bad aim, in order
to frighten them, not to kill them. For, as was said above, the
Emperor respected the religious significance of the day and did not
wish to engage in civil war between Christians. At the same
time, he ordered some other chosen leaders (each with his co-
horts‚ most of thern provided with bows, but some armed with
long lances) to charge forth suddenly from the gate which is close
to St. Romanus, thus presenting the appearance 01 violence to the
enemy. The battle line was so arranged that each spearman should
march protected on each side by bowmen armed with shields. Thus
arrayed‚ they were ordered to advance against the enemy at a slow
pace, and archers, instructed to turn about frequently here and
