202 THE FIRST CRUSADE

St. Andrew with Peter BartholomeW, lent his earS, and, as he said,
heard very many things, but remembered only this: “Lord‚ I say.''

But the Bishop of Agde said: “I know not whether it was in a
dream or not. A certain old man dressed in a white cloak and
holding in his hand the Lance of the Lord stood before me and said
to me, ‘Dost thou believe that this is the Lance of Jesus Christ ?'

“And I replied, ‘I believe, Lord.'

“And when he had thus questioned me a second and a third time,
Ι said ‘Verily I believe, Lord, that this is the Lance which drew
forth from the side of Jesus Christ the blood whence we all have
been redeemed.’ ''

And after this, the Bishop violently aroused me, who was sleep*
ing near. When Ι looked out, I saw an unwonted splendor, and,
feeling a certain grace of spirit, Ι began to ask of those who were
present whether they had noticed any disturbance among the people.
And all began to say, “Not at all.’' But when we said to one another
the things which we said above, that Peter to whom this revelation
had been made replied, “And truly enough did you here see a grace-
giving splendor, since the Father from whom all grace proceeds
stood here for some time.''

When, moreover, we asked him to make clear what had been told
him, he said this to us and the Count:

“On this night the Lord and St. Andrew carne here in the form
in which they have been wont to come before, together with a cer-
tain third person with a very long beard whose stature was slight
and who was dressed in linen. Then St. Andrew threatened me
much because I had left in an unworthy place the relies of his
body which were found in his church at Antioch, and said ‘When
I was hurled headlong from a mountain near Antioch by the
infidels, Ι broke two of my fingers, and after my death this man
took them and brought them to Antioch. But thou, when thou
didst find them, neglected them; one thou hast permitted to be
taken away from thee, the other thou hast unworthily neglected.'
And he showed his hand without the fingers. Then, Count‚ he
complained much about you, for, although you have received the
ineffable reward granted to no one else by the Lord, you do not
sear to sin gravely and wickedly in the sight of God. Therefore
the Lord showed you this sign. For five days ago when you offered
a candle on the festival of the blessed Fidus⁵ large enough to last
for three days and nights, it did not even give light, but melted
away immediately and was destroyed on the ground. Moreover‚
tonight you offered a candle so little that it could scarcely last till
cockcrow, and it is now day, and it still lasts‚ nor „has a third part
