8 THE FIRST CRUSADE

the lavish compliment of incorporating nearly the whole of his
work in their “literary'' accounts of the expedition. The great his-
torical value of the work rests not only in the fact that it was
written by an eye-witness and participant, but also upon the fact
that it was probably composed from time to time on the journey
and finished immediately after the battle of Ascalon in September
1099, the last event which it mentions. It is the first full account
of the Crusade still extant, and almost every other history of the
First Crusade is based either directly or indirectly upon it. Six
MS copies of it still remain, and all of the material has been pre-
served in one form or another in the later accounts of the Crusade.

The second chronicle listed, on the other hand, does not at all
efface its author, for the preface sets forth the authorship and the
purpose in full:

to all who dwell across the Alps the great deeds which God in the
usual manner of His love performed, and did not cease constantly
to perform, through us; especially so, since the unwarlike and the

But let him who shall see their apostacy shun their words and corn-
panionship! For the army of God, even if it bore the punishment
of the Lord Himself for its sins, out of His compassion also stood
forth victor over all paganism. But since some went through
Slavonia, others through Hungary, others through. Longobardy‚
and yet others by sea, it would be tedious for us to write about each.
Theret‘ore we have omitted the story of others and have taken it
as our task to write about ·the Count, the Bishop of Puy, and their
army.”

Pontius of Balazun, a knight in the Proveneal army, was killed at
Archas, and Raymond was thus left to complete the task alone.
Raymond had been elevated to the priesthood while on the Crusade
and had become the chaplain of Count Raymond of Toulouse, who
was the wealthiest leader on the expedition. The expense of compil-
ing the book was, therefore, a trivial matter. His intimacy with
Count Raymond and with Bishop Adhemar gave him access to much
information not available to such writers as the Anonymous. Critics
have been exceedingly harsh in their condemnation of both the form
and the content of the book. They condemn it as crude, bigoted,
intensely parfisan, and a mass of confused and credulous mysticism.
Partisan it undoubtedly is, for Raymond was writing to correct a
