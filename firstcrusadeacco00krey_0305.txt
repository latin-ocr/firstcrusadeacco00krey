THE FIRST CRUSADE 281

dentals now have been made Orientals. He who was a Roman or
a Frank is now a Galilaean‚ or an inhabitant of Palestine. One
who was a citizen of Rheims or of Chartres now has been made a
citizen of Tyre or of Antioch. We have already forgotten the
places of our birth; already they have become unknown to many of
us, or, at least, are unmentioned. Some already possess here homes
and servants which they have received through inheritance. Some
have taken wives not merely of their own people‚ but Syriam, or
Armenians, or even Saracens who have received the grace of bap-
tism. Some have with them father-in-law‚ or daughter-in-laW, or
son—in-law, or step-son, or step-father. There are here, too, grand-
children and great-grandchildren.²⁹ One cultivates vines, another
the fields. The one and the other use mutually the speech and the
idioms of the different la1iguages.³⁰ Different languages, now made
common, become known to both races‚ and saith unites those whose
forefathers were strangers. As it is written, “The lion and the ox
shall eat straw together.'’ Those who were strangers are now
natives; and he who was a sojourner now has become a resident.
Our parents and relatives from day to day come to join us, aban-
doning, even though reluctantly‚ all that they possess. For those
who were poor there, here God makes rich. Those who had few
coins, here possess countless besants; and those who had not had .
a villa, here, by the gift of God, already possess a city. Therefore,
why should one who has found the East so favorable return to the
West? God does not wish those to suffer want who, carrying their
crosses, have vowed to follow Him, nay even unto the end. Yon
see, therefore, that this is a great miracle, and one which must
greatly astonish the whole world. Who has ever heard anything
like it? Therefore‚*God wishes to enrich us all and to draw us to
Himself as His most dear friends. And because He wishes it, we
also freely desire the same; and what is pleasnig to Him we do
with a loving and submissive heart, that with Him we may reign
happily throughout eternity.
