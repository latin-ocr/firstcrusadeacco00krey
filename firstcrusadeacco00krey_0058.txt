42 THE FIRST CRUSADE

of the church of St. Gertrude of Nivelle38 alarmed them to such an
extent that they feared for their lives. This was the nature of the
disease. The patient, attacked in any part of the body by invisible
fire, suffered unspeakable torment for a long time, and without
remedy, until either he lost his life from the agony, or he lost both
the torture and the afflicted limb at the same time. There are to
this day living witnesses of this disease, maimed either in hands or
feet by the scourge.

Of the other nations‚ some peoples or individuals acknowledged
that they had been called to the land of promise not only by the
proclamation of the Pope, but also by certain prophets who had
lately arisen among thern, or by signs and revelations from heaven;
others confessed that they had been constrained to take the vows
by reason of embarrassed circumstances. Indeed, the majority set
out encumbered with their wives and children and all their house-
hold effects.

But for the East Franks, the Saxons, the Thuringians, the Ba-
varians, and the Alemmzni³⁹ this trumpet call sounded only faintly,
particularly because of the schism between the empire and the
papacy‚ from the time of Pope Alexander4⁰ even until today. This,
alas, has strengthened our hatred and enmity against the Romans,
as it has theirs towards us! And so it carne to pass that almost all
the Teutonic race, at first ignorant of the reason for this setting
out, laughed to scorn the many legions of knights passing through
their land, the many companies of foot soldiers, and the crowds of
country people, women, and little ones. They regarded them as
crazed with unspeakable folly, inasmuch as they were striving after
uncertainties in place of certainties and were leaving for naught
the land of their birth, to seek with certain danger the uncertain
land of promise; and, while giving up their own possessions, they
were yearning after those of strangers. But although our people
are more perverse than other races, yet in consideration of the
promise of divine pity, the enthusiasm of the Teutons was at last
turned to this same proclamation, for they were taught, forsooth,
what the thing really meant by the crowds passing through their
lands.

4. Urban’s instructions to tlte assembliny C rnsaders.

Urban, bishop, servant of the servants of God, to all the faithful,
both princes and subjects, waiting in Flanders; greeting, apostolic
grace, and blessing.

Your brotherhood, we believe, has long since learned from many
accounts that a barbaric fury has deplorably afflicted and laid waste
