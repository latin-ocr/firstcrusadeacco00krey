vi PREFACE

translations he is under great obligation to several of his former
students. Special acknowledgment is due to Sister Frances Rita
Ryan, MA. (Sisters of St. Joseph) for her contributions of the
passages from Fulcher and to Mrs. Willoughby M. Babcocl<‚ MA.
for a like service in the case of Ekkehard. Both have also as-
sisted in reading the proof sheetS. In the preparation ot' the in-
troduction and notes the works of numerous scholars in the
field have been placed under contribution. A few of these are
mentioned, but it would be quite impossible to enumerate them
all. The author must content himself with the expression of his
gratitude to Professor D. C. Munro, through whose seminar he,
like so many others, was first introduced to the study of this
period. Finally‚ I wish to acknowledge my indebtedness to my
wife, without whose help at all stages this work would not have

been completed.
