THE FIRST CRUSADE 59

under sentence of death, they should neither touch nor take by force
anything in the Kingdom of Hungary, and should stir up no quar-
rel, but that everything should be exchanged for a just price. Simi-
larly, the King commanded that it be proclaimed throughout his
realm that the army was to obtain every abundance of necessary
things, bread, wine, corn, oil, beasts of the field, and flying creature>-
οἱ the sky; and he commanded, under penalty of life, that the
Hungarians should not burden and enrage the army by unjust sell-
ing, but, rather, should make all buying easy for them.

And so, day by day, in quiet and in peace, with full measure and
just sale, the Duke and his people crossed the Kingdom of Hungary
and arrived at the river Drave. A heap of wood was gathered and
a large raft was made, on which they crossed the river. without

brother of the Duke, his wife, and all the hostages. There he re-
stored the ‘hostages to the Duke. Next, after very affectionately
favoring the Duke and his brother with many gifts and the kiss of
