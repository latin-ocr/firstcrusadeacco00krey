THE FIRST CRUSADE 115

day; and we took much booty—gold‚ silver, horses‚ asses, camels,
sheep, cattle, and very many other things which we do not know.
Had not God been with us in the battle and quickly sent us a sec-
ond battle line, not one of us would have escaped‚ for this fight
lasted from the third hour even to the ninth. But Almighty God,
holy and merciful, who neither permitted His knights to perish nor
to fall into the hands of the enemy, hastily sent us His aid. Two
honorable knights of ours, Godfrey of Mount Scaglioso, and Wil-
liam, son of Marchisus, brother of Tancred‚ died there, and (also)
other knights and foot-soldiers whose names Ι do not know.

Whoever will be wise or learned enough to dare to describe the
valor, skill, and fortitude of the Turks, who thought to frighten the
host of the Franks with the threats of their arrows, just as they
frighten the Arabs, Saracens, Armenians, Syrians, and Greeks?
But, please God, never will they be so powerful as our men. In-
deed, they say that they are of the Frankish racc, and that no one
ought naturally to be a knight except the Franks and themselves,
I shall speak the truth, which no one will dare deny. Certainly, if
they had ever been firm in the saith of Christ and holy Christianity‚

from the dead, and ascended to heaven while His disciples looked
on, and then, finally, sent the consolation of the Holy Spirit, and
had believed with a right mind and saith in Him, ruling in heaven
and on earth, no one could have found more powerful‚ braver, or
more skilful fighters than they. And yet, by the grace of God, they
were conquered by our men! This battle was fought on the first
day of July.

But after the Turks, enemies of God and holy Christianity‚ had ⁷
been entirely beaten, fleeing hither and thither for four days and
nights, it happened that Soliman, their Duke, son of the old Soli-
man, fled from Nicaea. He found ten thousand Arabs who said
to him, “O, unhappy and more unhappy than all the Gentiles! why
do you flee, terrified ?” To them Soliman tearfully replied: “Be-
cause just recently‚ when Ι had all the Franks beaten and thought
them already bound in captivity‚ and when I would soon have tied
them to one another, then, looking back, I saw such an innumerable
host of them that, if any of you had· been there, you would have
thought that all the mountains, hills, valleys, and level places were
filled with their multitude. Upon seeing them, we began imme-
diately to take to sudden ssight, so amazingly afraid that we hardly
escaped from their hands; wherefore we are still in very great
terror. And if you wish to believe me and my words, take your-
