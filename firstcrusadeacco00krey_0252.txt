230 THE FIRST CRUSADE

And I who have written this, in the presence of the brethren and
the Bishop said this there: “I was present while the digging took
place; and before all of the Lance appeared above the ground, I
kissed the point. And there are several in the army who were with
me.” And I added, “There is a certain other priest, Bertrand of
Puy by name, who was a servant of the Bishop of Puy during his
life. Moreover, this priest was sick unto death in Antioch; and
when he had already given up hope of his life, there came before
him the Bishop of Puy with his standard bearer, Heraclius, who,
in the greatest fight made at Antioch was wounded in the face by
an arrow while he was fearlessly launching forth against the lines
of the Turks, and as a consequence ended his life.

“And Heraclius said, ‘Lord, he is ill.’

“The Bishop replied, ‘He is ill because of his unbelief.'

“And the priest thereupon said: ‘Lord, do Ι not believe in the
Lance of the Lord, just as also the Passion of the Lord ?’

“Then the Bishop said to him, ‘And thou must yet believe many
other things.’ '’

And though this does not pertain to this matter, nevertheless,
since it is worthy, Ι will add something for the sake of good men.
When the priest had reseated himself before the Bishop and his
lord Heraclius, for he was sick and could not stand, he beheld in
the face of his lord the wound from which he had ended the labors
of his mortal life. And the priest said to him, “Sire, we believed
that thy wound had already healed. Why is this ?’'

Heraclius answered, “Well hast thou asked this question. When
Ι came before my Lord, Ι begged him that this wound might never
be closed, since because of it Ι ended my life. And this the Lord
granted me.” This and much else the Bishop and Heraclius said to
the priest, which are not now necessary (to relate).

When he had listened to these and many other men, Arnulf be-
lieved and confessed; and he promised the Bishop of Albara that
he would do penance in the presence of all the people for his un-
belief. However, on the appointed day when Arnulf had come,
summoned to council, he began to say that he would place full faith
in it (the Lance), but that he wished to speak with his lord before
doing penance. But when Peter Bartholomew heard this, he was
exceedingly angry, and like a plain man, and one who has well
known the truth, he said, “I wish and beg that a very large fire be
built3 and Ι will pass through the midst of it with the Lance of the
Lord. If it is the Lance of the Lord, Ι will pass through the fire
unhurt, but if it is not, Ι will be burned in the fire. For Ι see

.-’ that neither signs nor witnesses are believed.”
