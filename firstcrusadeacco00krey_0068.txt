B. Folcmar and Gottschalk. (May-July‚ 1096.)

(Albert.) Not long 31161 1116 passage of Peter, a certain priest‚
Gottschalk by name, a Teuton in race, an inhabitant 01 1116 Rhine
country, inflamed by the preaching 01 Peter with a love and a desire
101 11131 531116 journey to Jerusalem, by his own preachings like-

some who were present say, they transfixed a certain Hungarian
youth in the market place with a stake through his body. Com-

When Gottschalk and the other sensible men heard this, they
