278 THE FIRST CRUSADE

multitude to flight as a result of our charge alone, and snatched
away all their arms, so that if they should wish thereafter to fight
against us, they would not have arms to rely upon. As to the
quantity of spoil, however, which was captured, no question should
be asked where the treasures of the King of Babylon were con-
cerned. In that place we killed more than one hundred thousand
Moors by the sword. The fear of these people, moreover, was so
great that about two thousand of them were suffocated in the gate
of the city. Of those, furthermore, who perished in the sea, there
is no count. Thickets of thorns, likewise, held many of them.
The world was surely fighting in our behalf, and had not the spoils
of the camp detained many of our men, there would be few of that
great multitude of the enemy able to bring back tidings of the battle.
And though it may be tedious, nevertheless this should not be
omitted: on the day before the battle was to occur the army cap—
tured many thousands of camels, oxen, and sheep. And when the
people let them go, at the command of the princes, wonderful to re-
late, the camels formed many and multiple squadrons, the oxen and
sheep likewise. Moreover, these animals accompanied us so closely
that they halted when we halted, marched when we marched, and
charged when we charged. Clouds, too, protected us from the heat
of the sun and cooled us.

And so, when the victory had been celebrated, the army returned
to Jerusalem. Leaving Duke Godfrey there, Raymond, Count of
St. Gilles, Robert, Count of Normandy, and Robert, Count of
Flanders2⁷ returned to Laodicaea, where they found the fleet of the
Pisans and Bohemund. And when the Pisan Archbishop had
brought Bohemund and our lords into concord, Count Raymond
arranged to return to Jerusalem for the sake of God and our
brothers.

Accordingly, in addition to such wonderful devotion of bravery
on the part of our brothers, such glorious and coveted retribution
on the part of the Omnipotent‚ such greatly desired remissiori of
all our sins through the Grace of God, and exaltation of the Catholic
church of Christ and all the Latin people‚ we urge that He may
cause you also to sit at the right hand of God, who liveth and
reigneth God forever and ever. Amen.

We ask and beseech you through the Lord Jesus who was ever
with us, shared our labors, and snatched us from tribulationS, that
you be mindful of your brethren, who are returning to you, by
benefitting them, and cancelling their debts, that God may benefit
you and absolve you from all your sins, that God may grant you a
share in all the blessings which we or they have deserved from

God. Amen.
