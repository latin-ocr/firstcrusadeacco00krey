THE FIRsT CRUSADE 199

ment that you see, because when Ι received the order of the episco-
pate I gave it in the name of God to a certain poor man. And
though Gehenna was exceedingly hot and the ministers of Tartarus
raged against me, yet they could do no harm beneath it. Nothing
of all that Ι brought from my fatherland has been of such value
to me as this candle which my friends offered here for me and
those three denarii which Ι offered to the Lance, for these have
restored me when, suffering in hell, I was near unto death. Lord
Bohemund said that he would bear my body to Jerusalem. Let
him know that it is to his advantage not to move me, for the blood
of the Lord who accompanies me is still there. But if he doubts
this which Ι say, let him open my tomb and he will see my head
and face burned. I have committed my following to my lord the
Count; let it comfort him that God bestows His mercy upon him
and fulfils what He has promised him. And let my brothers not
grieve that I have finished life, since I never was so useful as I will
now be, if they are willing to observe the commands of God. For
Ι shall dwell with them and likewise all my brothers who, like
myself, have ended this life; and Ι shall appear and shall counsel
them much better than hitherto. And you, my brothers, be mindful
of the punishments of hell which are so severe and so dreadful.
Accordingly, serve God who can deliver you from these and other
evils. How well-born is he who shall know not the punishments of
hell! This the Saviour can grant to those who observe His pre-
cepts. Keep what remains of this candle in the morning. And let
the Count‚ together with those he may wish‚ choose a bishop in my
place, since it is not just for the Blessed Mary to have no bishop
after my death. Give one of my cloaks to the church of St. An-
drew.''

And the blessed Andrew knelt down to Him. After this, St.
Andrew, sitting nearer, spoke as follows: “Let all* hear what the
Lord speaks through me: Be mindful, Count, of that gift which the
Lord gave to thee ; strive to work in His name, that the Lord may
direct thy deeds and words, and heed thy prayer. The first gift
which the Lord conferred upon thee, Nicaea, has been turned from
Him. God gave thee His city and took it from His enemies and
afterwards was not recognized there. If anyone invoked the name
‘of the Lord, he was beaten there, and the deeds of the Lord were
not done there. But because of His kindness the Lord has not
willed to refuse that which thou seekest, and even more than thou
hast dared to ask. For he gave thee the Lance which wounded
His body, whence the blood of our redemption flowed forth.
But He did not give it thee to do with as thou didst with the
