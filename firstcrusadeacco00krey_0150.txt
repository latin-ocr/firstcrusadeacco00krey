128 THE FIRST CRUSADE

However, since these matters had become clearly known in the
camp, Bohemund was chosen to go out against them. Moreover,
the Counts of Flanders and Normandy set out with him. They
could not lead out more than one hundred and fifty knights, and had
not the shame of returning restrained them, they would have turned
back because of the few knights. Thus, God urging them, they
set forth, found the enemy and pursued them and forced them to
destruction in the river. When they had thus gained the victor)
and spoils, they returned with great exultation to the camp. In
the meanwhile the Genoese ships had landed bn the coast, which was
about ten miles from the camp. That place, moreover, was called
the Port of St. Simeon.

And now the enemy, going forth from the city little by little,
killed the squires or peasants who were herding the horses and
cattle beyond the river, and they took great plunder into the city.
For we had placed the tents near the river and had made a bridge
of the ships which were found there. However, the city also had a
bridge, which was on the lower western corner, and there was a
certain little mountain opposite us, where there were two mosques
and some casalia of tombs. We mention these things, moreover,
that the deeds which we will describe as done there will be easily
clear. Just as we said, when the boldness of the enemy had some-
what increased, our men going forth from the camp, though fre-
quently fewer than the enemy, were, nevertheless, not afraid to
attack them. The Turks, however, though frequently scattered and
put to ssight, rose up again for battle there, not only because they
had the swiftest horses and were nimble and unburdened with arms,
other than bows, but also because in the bridge, which we have
mentioned, they had a hope of refuge. They looked forward to
the chance of shooting arrows at a distance from the little moun-
tain, for their bridge was about one mile distant from our bridge.
On the plain, moreover, which lay between the two bridges there
were constant assaults and daily fights. It happened, indeed, at the
beginning of the siege that the Count and the Bishop of Puy placed
their camp near the river, and thus nearer the enemy, they were
most frequently attacked by them. And so it came about through
assaults of this kind that they lost all their horses, because the
Turks, not prepared to fight with lances or swords, but with ar-
rows at a distance, were to be feared while they fled, as well as
when they pursued.
