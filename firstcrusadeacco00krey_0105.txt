THE FIRST CRUSADE 87

for the splendid victory which he had gained over Bohemund when
the latter engaged him in battle at Larissa. And dreaming that if
they were of one mind they could take Constantinople itself, they
had combined with the same thought and purpose of which we have
often made mention above. Thus, apparently they were making
an expedition to Jerusalem; in reality, however, they wanted to
divest the Emperor of his kingdom and take Constantinople. But
the Emperor, long since acquainted with their wiles, by letter or-
dered forces of Gentiles with their leaders to be stationed by squad-
rons from the Athyras river up to Phssea, a seaport on the Black
Sea. (He also ordered them) to watch in ambush for anyone sent,
perchance, by Godfrey to Bohemund and the rest of the counts who
were following, or by these, in turn, to him, and to deny these
messengers all passage.

In the meantime, while this was going on, the following incident
occurred, somewhat in this way. The Emperor had summoned be-
fore him some of the counts who had come with Godfrey, in order
to urge that they consent to persuade Godfrey to carry out the
promise which he had made under oath. While the time was thus
being dragged out longer (than expected), for the reason that the

Latin race is by nature exceedingly garrulous and wordy‚ there
was reported to these people the false rumor that the counts had ’

been taken into custody at the Emperor’s command. Thereupon‚
‚the Latin legions surged together in a huge crowd and moved upon
Byzantium and without delay utterly destroyed the palaces which
are situated toward the swamp called Aryyra. At the same time
they tried the walls of the city, not with siege maohines, for they
were not at hand, but, trusting in their multitude, they resorted to a
piece of insolence: they dared to set fire to the lower gate of the
palace located near the Temple, which had been built in olden
times by one of the Emperors under the invocation of Nicolaus,
the greatest of the holy pontiffs.

At the sight of the Latin legions, not only did all of the basest
class, the foolish and the unwarfike, groan, cry out, and beat their
breasts in their sear, not knowing what else to do; but even the
zealous adherents of the Emperor, mindful of that Friday on which
the seizure of the city had formerly taken place‚12 feared the pres-
ent day lest vengeance should fall violently upon them for the deeds
committed at that time. However, all who had any acquaintance

with military practice and skill poured in at the regal palace, ·

each man coming by himself. But the Emperor neither armed his
sides with breastplate of scale-armon his left hand with a shield,
his right with a spear, nor girded himself about with a sword3
