Moreover, Jerusalem was captured by the Christians in the year
1099, on the Ides of July‚ the sixth day of the week, in the Seventh
Indiction‚ the third year of their setting forth. Their first battle
was at the bridge over the river Orontes, in which many Turks were
killed on the ninth day before the Kalends of March. The second
battle was fought at Nicaea on the third day before the Nones of
March, in which the pagans were beaten by the Christians. Their
third battle was on the fourth day before the Kalends of July‚ at
Antioch, the Lance of the Lord, recently found, preceding them.
The fourth occurred on the Kalends of July‚ Moreover, the Turks
were likewise beaten in Romania. Their fifth battle occurred on
the Ides of July‚ when, after the thirty ninth day of the siege,
Jerusalem was captured. Their sixth battle was fought on the
fourth day before the Kalends of August, at Ascalon, against the
king of Babylon, in which Ioo,ooo knights, and 4o,ooo foot-soldiers
were defeated and destroyed by a small army of Christians. Thanks
be to God! The letter endeth.

The Pope¹s response to the news of tlze capture of Jerusalem.

(Paschal) Paschal, bishop, servant of the servants of God, to all

archbishops, bishops, and abbots throughout Gaul; greeting and
apostolic blessing.

We owe boundless gratitude to the compassion of Almighty God,
since in our time He has deigned to wrest the Church in Asia from
the hands of the Turks and to open to Christian soldiers the very*
city of the Lord's suffering and burial. However, we ought to
follow Divine grace with what means He has given us, and ef-
fectively aid our brethren who have remained in those districts
which were once the lands of the people of Palestine or Canaan.
Urge, therefore, all the soldiers of your region to strive for remis-
sion and forgiveness of their sins by hastemng to our Mother
Church of the East; especially compel those who have assumed the
sign of the cross in pledge of this journey to hasten thither, unless
they are prevented by the hindrance of poverty.²³ Moreover, we
decree that those be held in disgrace who left the siege of Antioch
through weak or questionable faith; let them remain in excom-
munication, unless they affirm with certain pledges that they will
return. We furthermore command that all their possessions be
restored to those brethren who are returning after the victory of
the Lord, just as you recall was ordained in a synodal decree by
Urban‚ our predecessor of blessed memory. Do thus in all matters,
being so zealous in your duty that by common zeal our Mother
Church of the East may be restored to her due state, the Lord

granting it.
