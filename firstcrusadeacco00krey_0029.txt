THE FIRST CRUSADE 13

much of the material was taken from a Lorraine chronicle now lost,
an explanation plausible enough, though thus far not substantiated.
At any rate, his items of information cannot be ignored‚ and they
may be of full value. Until further evidence is discovered, the
question cannot be settled positively.⁶ Only excerpts on the *Peas-
ants’ Crusade and Godfrey’s march to Constantinople are here
translated from Albert.

The other three works included in this translation because their
authors were present at the Council of Clermont may be grouped
together as literary histories. None of the writers accompanied the
expedition, but each wrote a history of the whole Crusade, thus
illustrating the deep interest of the people of Europe in the subject.
All three were churchmen of high position, and each sought to
rewrite the crude account of the Gesta in more literary form. They
succeeded in varying degree, but their names are remembered, while
that of the original author has been irretrievably lost. Robert the μ
Monk is generally identified as the monk chosen Abbot of Saint-
Remi of Rheims in 1094, and later forced to retire to the priory of
Senuc. His work was written at the request of Bernard, Abbot of
Marmoutier, sometime before 1107. It adds little to the Gesta,
but was very popular in the twelfth century. More than eighty

MS copies ot' it are still extant. Balderic, Abbot of Bourgeuil, *v

and Archbishop of Dol after 1107, added little more than Robert
to the Gesta account. His work was written after 1107 and was
also quite popular. Seven MS copies remain. The best of these
three accounts is that of Guibert, who was Abbot of Nogent from
1104 to 1121. He composed his book between 1108 and 1112 and
dedicated it to Lisiard, Bishop of Soissons. Guibert was one of

the leading scholars of his time, well versed in classica] lore, which 2²1⁵„ ¹- · ·
he used to adorn his accounts of the Crusade. He was also fairly ι “

well informed about matters in northern France. His additions to
the Gesta contain many valuable items ‘about the crusading leaders
from that region. Four MS copies of his work are preserved.

V. TERMINOLOGY.

In the translation of these accounts a conscious effort has been
made to reproduce as nearly as possible the style and manner of
expression of the original. Though the writers all used the same
language, they employed different words and idioms to describe
the same occurrences, even the ordinary incidents of life. Under
the circumstances, it was felt that too much would be lost if the
expressions were all translated in the standard idiom of today.
