THE FIRST CRUSADE 169

army os: the retiring enemy, was captured and deprived of his head.
Fear and grief, accordingly, assailed our men, so that many were
led to the desperate hope of ssight. Thereupon, when the Turks
had once and again suffered a repulse in fighting, they besieged the
fortress on the third day; and the fighting was carried on there
with such violence that the might ot' God alone was believed to
defend the fortress and resist the adversaries. For when the Turks
were already prepared to cross the moat and destroy the walls,
they were taken with fright, I know not why, and rushed headlong
into ssight. Then, seeing no reason for their ssight, they returned
to the siege after they had run a short distance, blaming their own
timidity; and, as if to atone for the disgrace of the flight they had
made, they attacked more violently and again were more violently
terrified by the might of God. Therefore the enemy returned to
their camp on that day. On the next day, however, they returned
to the fortress with a very great supply ot' siege machinery, but
our men set fire to the fortress and thrust themselves within the
walls of the city. And thus, as the fear of the Franks was increased,
the boldness of the enemy grew; forsooth, we had nothing outside
the city, and the fortress‚ which was the head ot‘ the city, was held
by our foes. The Turks, emboldened by this, arranged to enter
against us by the fortress. Our men, however, relying on their
favorable and lofty location, fought against the enemy and at the
first attack overthrew them; but, sorgetful' of the threatening battle
and intent upon plunder, they (in turn) were most vilely put to
flight. For more than a hundred men were suffocated in the gate
of the city, and even more horses. Then the Turks who had entered
the fortress wanted to go down into the city. For the valley
between our mountain and their fortress was not large, and in the
middle of it was a certain cistern and a little level place. Nor did·
the enemy have a path down into the city except through our moun—
tain; wheret'ore they strove with every intent and all their might
to drive us out and remove u's from their path. The battle was
waged with such force from morning to evening that nothing like
it was ever heard of. There was a certain {rightful and as yet un-
heard of calamity besell us, for amidst the hail of arrows and
rocks, and the consta-at charge of javelins, and the deaths of so
kmany, our men became unconscious. If you ask for the end of

this fight, it was night.
