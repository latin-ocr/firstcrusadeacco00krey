But when the Emperor heard of the whole affair and learned how
great was the slaughter of men, he held it very wrong that Peter
should also be taken. Immediately, therefore, he summoned Cata-
calon Constantine Euphorbenus‚⁰ of whom mention has often been
made in this history, and sent him with suitable forces on war-
vessels across the sea as a succour to Peter. When the Turks saw
him approach, they fied. . . .

(Anna.) As we said above, there were among the Latins such
men as Bohemund and his fellow counsellors, who, eager to obtain
the Roman Empire for themselves, had been looking with avarice
upon it for a long time. Seeing an opening for their plans in the
expedition which was promoted by Peter, they stirred up this huge

Maurocatacalon, in command of the fleet, had arranged his ships at
stations around the port of Durazzo, so that he could make excur-

cretly approach. To each of these men, therefore, the Emperor,
after hearing this letter (from Hugh), immediately sent a message,
bidding the Governor of Durazzo watch closely by land and sea

ceived magnificently. He further ordered the commander of the
fleet to be constantly alert and on the watch with every faculty

Meanwhile Hugh reached the seacoast of Longobardy; there he
