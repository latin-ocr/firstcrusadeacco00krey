106 THE FIRST CRUSADE

our leaders ordered machines of war to be made, rams, scrapers,
wooden towers, and slings. Arrows were shot from the bows, and
destructive stones were hurled. Our enemy fired at us, and we at
them, each doing his best in these encounters. With our machines
we often assailed the city, but because a strong wall resisted us, the
attack failed. Turks often perished, struck by arrows or stones,
and Franks likewise. Truly, you would have grieved and sobbed
in pity, for when they slew one of our men before the wall in any
way, they let down iron hooks by means of ropes and took the
body up. They snatched it away, and none of us dared, or was
able, to wrest it from them. After stripping the corpse, they threw
the body outside.

Then, with the aid of oxen and ropes, we dragged some small
boats from Civitote over land to Nicaea and launched them in the
lake to guard the approach to the city, lest it be supplied with pro—
visions. But while we were wearying the city with siege for five
weeks and had often terrified the Turks with our attacks, a council
had meantime been held, and through ambassadors to the Emperor
the inhabitants secretly surrendered to him the city, which was al-
ready hard pressed by our forces and skill. Then the Turks admit-
ted into it the Turcopoles sent thither by the Emperor. They took
possession of the city, with all the money in it, in the name of the
Emperor, just as he had commanded. Wherefore, after all this
money was taken, the Emperor ordered gifts to be presented to our
leaders, gifts of gold, and silves, and raiment; and to the foot-sol-
diers he distributed brass coins, which they call tartarons. On the
day of the siege and the surrender of Nicaea, the month of June
had reached the solstice.

(Anselm.) To his reverend lord‚ Manasses, by grace of God
Archbishop of Rheims, Anselm of Ribemont‚ his liege-man and
humble servant in the Lord; greeting.

Inasmuch as you are our lord‚ and as the kingdom of the whole
of France is especially dependent upon your care, we are notifying
you, father, of the events which have befallen us; how, forsooth,
the army of the Lord is bearing itself. In the first place, we are
aware that a disciple is not above his master, nor a servant above
his lord; yet, may it be pardoned us, we advise and beseech you in
the Lord Jesus to consider what you are, what also is the priestly
and pontifical duty. Provide, therefore, for our land, so that both
the nobles live in concord among themselves, and the people labor
in security on that which is theirs, and the ministers of Christ.
leading a quiet and peaceful life, be free to devote themselves to the
Lord. I likewise pray you and the canons of the Holy Mothe?
