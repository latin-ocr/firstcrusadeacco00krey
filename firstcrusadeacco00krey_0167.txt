THE FIRST CRUSADE 1451

ῃ nified our Lord God, Three in One, in whom they happily triumphed,

crying aloud with one voice, “NVherefore didst thou not defend
our blood which to-day was shed for Thy name ?''’

Bohemund, therefore, did not hold to the road which they had
taken, but with a few knights came more quickly to us who were
gathered together. Then‚ angered at the killing of our men, we
called upon the name of Christ, and putting our trust in the march
to the Holy Sepulchoe, together went out against them for battle
and attacked them with one heart and one mind. The enemies of
God and ourselves stood thoroughly astounded and greatly terrified,
thinking that our men would conquer and kill them, just as they
themselves had done the people of the Count and Bohemund. But
Almighty God did not accord them this end. Therefore the true
knights of God, armed on all sides with the sign of the cross, rushed
fiercely upon them and attacked them violently, but they fied
quickly by means of the narrow bridge to their entrance. Those
who could not cross the bridge alive, because of the multitude of'
people and horses there, received eternal death and yielded their
unhappy souls to the devil and the ministers of Satan. And so

wretched fate of the Turks and stealthily applauded with their
hands, as was their custom. The Armenians and Syrians, willing
or unwilling, shot arrows out at us by order of the Turkish leaders.
Likewise‚ there were killed in body and soul at that battle twelve
Emirs of the Turkish horde, and others of the foremost and braver
knights who took a leading part in the defense of the city. The
number (of these) was fifteen hundred. The rest who remained
alive dared no longer shout or chatter by night or by day, as they
had formerly been wont to do. And so night alone overcame all
of thern and us, and night prevented both sides from fighting,
hurling, pieming, and shooting. Thus our enemies were overcome
by the valor of God and the Holy Sepulchre‚ and they could no
longer have such strength, either in voice or deed, as they had
before. And thus on that day we were bountifully supplied with
