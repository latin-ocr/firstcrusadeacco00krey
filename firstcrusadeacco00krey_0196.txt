standing back before the fortress, a certain priest came to them and
said: “Seignors, if it please you, listen to a certain matter which
l saw in a vision. When one night Ι was lying in the church of
St. Mary, Mother of God, our Lord Jesus Christ, the Saviour of
the world, appeared to me with His mother and St. Peter, prince of
the apostles, and stood before me and said, ‘Knowest thou me ?’

“1 answered, ‘No.' At these words, lo, a whole cross appeared
on His head.

“A second time, therefore, the Lord asked me ‘Knowest thou
