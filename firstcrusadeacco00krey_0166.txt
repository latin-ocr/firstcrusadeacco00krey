(Gesta). However, when our leaders saw that those of our
enemy who were in the city were doing us damage and harassing
us, watching and lying in ambush wherever they could hurt us,
they assembled together and said, ‘'Before we lose our people, let
us build a sort at the mosque which is before the gate of the city,
where the bridge is; and there, perchance, we will be able to harass
our ene1ny.'’ All agreed, and approved it as a good thing to be
done. The Count of St. Gilles spoke first and said, “Help me build

men), and cruelly cutting them down with the sword. For 50
fiercely did they attack our forces that the latter took to ssight over
the top of the mountain, and wherever a passageway was open.
He who could advance at rapid pace escaped alive, but he who could
