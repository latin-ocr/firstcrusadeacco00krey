192 THE FIRST CRUSADE

passion of God, they glorified Christ. Moreover‚ after a fast of
three days had been prescribed, they devoted themselves to prayer,
confessed what wrongs they had done, and marched around the
churches with bared feet. After this was done, each army equipped
itself for battle.

“On the vigils of the apostl'es Peter and Paul, our men, after
invoking the name of Christ, marched out of the city. The Bishop
of St. Mary of Puy preceded, bearing the Cross and the triumphal
Lance of the Saviour. The priests and many clerics followed,
dressed in white vestments. And when they had advanced thus for
about three miles to the field, they beheld a wonderful standard,
white and exceeding high, and with it a countless host of knights
At the same time a wind and cloud of dust arose and drove the
Turks into such flight that the fugitives cast away their arms, and
even their very garments. And thus, God scattering thern, they

life along the way which they are to take among barbarous nations.
We also make it known to you that Lord Pope Urban holds a
council at Bari, considering and arranging (matters) with many
senators of the land (who are) soon to take the road to Jerusalem.

(Crusadinq Princes). But when we wished to attack the citadel
on the next day, we saw overrunning all the fields an infinite multi-
tude of Turks, whose coming we had been expecting for many
days, while outside the city. These besieged us on the third day,
and more than one hundred of their soldiers entered the citadel;
for they wanted to break through the gate into the portion of the
city located below the citadel, common to both ourselves and them.
