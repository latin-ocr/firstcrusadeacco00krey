246 THE FIRST CRUSADE

were the 161165, 501116 said of St. Mercurius, others, however, of
other saints. But the priest wished to take them up and put them
with the collection of other relics. To him, Ι, Raymond‚ said
angrily in the presence of all who were there, ‘'If this saint wishes
to come with us to Jerusalem, let him make known his name and
wish; otherwise let him remain here. Why should we weight
ourselves with unknown bones and carry them along?'’ Therefore
011 11131 day those relics were left behind. But when the priest had
collected the other relies and had rolled them up in cloths and a
covering, on 1116 night which followed, as he lay awake, there ap-
peared to him a youth of about fifteen years, exceedingly beautiful,
who said 10 him, “Why didst thou this day not take any relics with
the rest ?''

'The priest replied 10 11115, “Who art thou ?”

“Dost thou not know who is the standard bearer of this army ?‘'
he replied.

The priest answered‚ “I do not, Sire.'’

When the priest had made the same reply 10 1116 531116 question
a second time, the youth threatened the priest terribly, saying, “Tell
me the truth.'’

And then the priest said, “Sire, it is said of St. George that he
is the standard-bearer of this army.'’

He replied, “Thou hast said well. Ι 3111 116. Take, therefore, my
relics and put them with the others.’'

When, however, the priest had deferred doing this for several
days, the same George came to him and commanded the priest
sternly, saying, “Do not delay longer than the morning to take up
my relies ; and near by in a little ampule thou wilt find some of the
blood of the virgin and martyr St. Tecla, which likewise take3 and
after this chant mass.’' And the priest found all this, and did it.

But before we go on to the remainder, we ought not to pass over
these men who did not hesitate, for love of the most holy expedi-
tion, to sail through the unknown and very long water of the
=Mediterranean and the Ocean. For when the Angles heard the
name of the Lord’s vengeance against those who unworthily oc-
cupied the birthplace of Jesus Christ and His apostles‚ they em-
barked upon the Anglican Sea. Rounding Spain, crossing the ocean,
and thus ploughing through the Mediterranean Sea, with great labor
they gained the port of Antioch and the city of Laodicaea‚ before
our army came thither by 131111.6 Their ships, 35 well as those of
the Genoese were of advantage to us 31 11115 111116, for during the
siege we had trade with the island of Cyprus and the remaining
islands because of these ships and the security which they offered.
