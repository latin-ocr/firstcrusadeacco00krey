244 THE FIRST CRUSADE

we say much about them? Surely that people had conspired against
the Holy of Holies and His inheritance! Except by the command
and direction of God, the people of the Franks would have en-
countered these ills, had not God straightway armed brute animals‘
against their enemies, as He did once in our presence.3 And so
much sor this.

XVhen those Surians who, as we said above, came to the Count,
were asked about the better route, they replied: “The way through
Damascus is level ancl full of vituals; but you will not find water
for two days. The other way through the mountains of. Lebanon
is sate enough and well watered, but it is very hard t'or the pack
animals and camels. There is another way along the sea, where
there are so many and such narrow passes that if fifty or a hundred
Saracens want to hold them, they can do so against all mankind.
And yet it is contained in the Gospel of St. Peter, which we have,
that if you are the people who are to take Jerusalem, you will pass
along the sea-coast, though because of the difficulty it seems impos-¹
sible to us. Moreover, there is written in that Gospel among us not
only what you have done, but also what you ought to do about this
march and many other things.’'

While some were urging in this and other ways, and others were
contradicting, william Hugo of Monteil returned with the Cross
of which we spoke above} Moreover, when the friends of the
Count likewise beheld this Cross, they became so eager for the march
that, except for the counsel of the Count and the other princes,
the servants of the Count would have burned their huts and been
the first to leave the siege of Archas. Thereupon, the Count was
disturbed to tears and even to hatred of himself and his people.
But the Duke of Lorraine especially wished this journey and ad-
monished the people to it, Accordingly, having set forth from that
detestable and hateful siege of Archas, we came before Tripoli.
Even then Count Raymond with prayers and gifts urged all the
nobles to besiege the city of Tripoli, but all opposed him.

At this time, St. Andrew appeared to Peter Desiderius, of whom
we have made mention above, and said to him, “Go and speak to
the Count, saying: ‘Do not molest thyselt' or others, for unless
Jerusalem shall first have been taken, thou shalt have no help. Do
not trouble thyselt' about the unfinished siege of Archas; let it not
weigh upon thee that this city, or others which are on the journey,
are not taken at present, because a fight will soon come upon thee
in which these and many other cities shall be captured. F urther-
more, do not trouble thyself or thy men, but distribute freely in
His name whatever God shall grant to thee, and be a companion
