THE FIRsT cnusADE 79

sent envoys to the Governor of Durazzo, twenty-four in number,
each decorated with gold and red breastplates. Along with them
went Count Car-pentes and that Helia who had fied from the Em-
peror at Thessalonica. These men addressed the following message
to the Governor:

“Be it known to you, O Governor, that our lord, Hugh, will soon
be here, bringing with him from Rome the golden banner of St.
Peter; moreover, know that he is the highest leader of all the
armies of France. Prepare yourself, therefore, to receive him and
the army obeying him according to the dignity of his power3 and
gird yourself about to meet him.''

While they were thus commanding the Governor, Hugh, as it is
said, came from Rome into Longobardy; and leaving Bari toward
Illyricum, he was caught by a most awful storm and lost the greater
number of his ships, together with their oarsmen and passengers.
The little boat in which he saved himself was cast up by the waves,
as though they spewed it forth, on the seacoast which lies half
way between Durazzo and another place called Palus. It, too, was
half cut to pieces. Two men, who were on the watch for his ar-
rival, met him after he had been saved and pressed him with these
words: “The Governor is awaiting your arrival, desiring very
much to enjoy your coniing.'' Thereupon, Hugh immediately asked
for a horse, and one of those men, dismounting from his horse,
very dutifully gave it over to him. As a result, the Governor, after
seeing that Hugh was safe‚ was the first to greet him and asked
whither‚ and whence, and what dangers and evils had befallen him
in sailing. And when he had been set upon his feet and refreshed
with kind words, the Governor then put before him a well-prepared
feast. After dinner he loosed him, but did not yet permit him to
walk about freely, for all these things had been quickly announced
to the Emperor, and the Governor was waiting to find out his
commands from him.

When the Emperor was informed, he quickly sent Butumites to
Epidamnus, which we have often called Durazzo, with orders
to bring Hugh back with him and not to return by the direct road, V,
but‚ by turning aside‚ to bring him to Constantinople through Philip· “s-
popolis; for he was afraid of the forces and throngs of Gauls who] l
followed. The Emperor treated him honorably with all kindness'
and gave him, in addition, considerable sums of moneys He im-
mediately urged the man to attach himself to him (the Emperor),
and to bind himself by the customary oaths of the Latins. . . .
