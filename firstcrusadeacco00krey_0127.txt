THE FIRST CRUSADE 109

greatly delighted; indeed, he valued it much more highly and was
better pleased that Ι had remained at such a time 'than if I had given
him a mountain of gold. On that same island on which he was
staying the great Emperorffi ordered the distribution of the more
precious spoils of the city of Nicaea that the knights were to have
such things as gold, gemS, silver, robes, horses, and the like; all
victuals were to be distributed among the foot—soldiers; all the
princes he arranged to enrich from his own treasurevs',

As we have said before, God triumphing, the very large city of
Nicaea was surrendered on the 13th day before the Kalends of
July. It is read in (the history of) the primitive church that the
holy fathers celebrated a synod at Nicaea and, after the Arian heresy
had been destroyed, there confirmed by the teaching of the Holy
Spirit the faith of the Holy Trinity. And this city, which because
of its sins later became a mistress of error, now, by the mercy
of God, has been made, through His sinful servants, a disciple of
truth. I tell you, my beloved, that in five weeks we will reach
Jerusalem from Nicaea, the city so often mentioned, unless Antioch

the Gauls and advance with them against the barbarians, yet, sear-

outside, as well as the conditions in the city. . . .

The august Emperor tarried about Pelacanum for some time,
since he desired those Gallic counts who were not yet bound to him
also to take the oath of loyalty. To this end, he sent a letter to
Butumites, asking all the counts in common not to start upon the
journey to Antioch until they had said farewell to the Emperor.
If they did this, they would all be showered with new gifts by him.
Bohemund was the first to prick up his ears at the mention of money
and gifts. Quickly won by these words of Butumites, he strove in-
dustriously to force all the others to return to the Emperor—so
greatly did cupidity move the man. The Emperor received thern
on their arrival at Pelecanufm with magnificence and the greatest
show of good-will. At length, when they were assembled, he ad-
dressed them thus: “You know that you have all bound yourselves
to me by oath; if you do not now intend to ignore this, advise and
persuade those of your number who have not yet pledged faith to
take the oath.’' They immediately summoned the counts who had
not sworn. All of these came together and took the oath.
