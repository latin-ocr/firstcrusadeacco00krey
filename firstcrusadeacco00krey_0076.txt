60 THE FIRST CRUSADE

these words: “Alexius, Emperor of Constantinople, of the King-
dom of the Greeks, to Duke Godfrey and his fellow princes3 sin-
cere affection. Ι ask, most Christian Duke, that you do not suffer
your people to plunder or to lay waste my lands and kingdom which
you have entered, but that you secure the privilege of buying. By
our order you will find everything in abundance for buying and
selling.'’⁴> Upon hearing this message, the Duke promised to obey in
all things the mandate of the Emperor. Thereupon, it was pro-
claimed to all that thereafter they should touch nothing with undue
violence, except food for their horses. And s0‚ peacefully crossing
over at the request of the Emperor, they arrived at his fortress,

he set out to Adrianople. After crossing a river by swimming his
horses, he pitched his tents and passed the night there. On the
next day, a bridge which crosses a river in the middle of the city
was forbidden to him and his followers by the inhabitants. Then
arising and hastening to Salabria, they pitched their tents in pleas-
