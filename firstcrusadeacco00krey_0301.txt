THE FIRST CRUSADE 277

tributary, since, forsooth, one of the many cities which are on that
sea—coast had more men than were in our army. And when they
heard at Antioch, at Laodicaea, and at Edessa that the hand of the
Lord was with us, more of the army who had remained there over-
took us at Tyre.

Accordingly, with God thus our Fellow-voyager and Helper, we
came even to Jerusalem. And while the army was laboring in the
siege of that city with great difficulty, especially on account of the
scarcity of water, a council was held, and the bishops and princes
announced that a procession was to be made around the city with
bare feet. (This was done) that He who had entered it in humility
for our sake might, through our humility, open it to us to do justice
on His enemies for His sake. Accordingly, the Lord, pleased at
this humility, granted the city with His enemies to us on the eighth
day after our humiliation, on this day, to wit, when the primitive
Church was expelled from Jerusalem, the day when the festival of
the Dispersion of the Apostles is celebrated by many of the faith-
ful. And, if you desire to know what was done about the enemy
whom we found there, know that in the portico of Solonion and in
his Temple, our men rode in the blood of the Saracens up to the
knees of the horses.

Then, when it had been arranged who should hold the city, and
the others wanted to return horne for love of their fatherland, or
affection for their parents, it was announced that the King of Baby-

lead the Franks who were at Jerusalem into captivity‚ and to take
Antioch by storm. So he himself had said; the Lord, however, had
decided otherwise concerning us. Accordingly, when we had found
out in truth that the army of Babylon was at Ascalon, we hastened
to meet them, leaving our baggage and our sick at Jerusalem with
a garrison. When our army was face to face with that of the
«enemy, upon bended knees we invoked God as our aid, who in our
other times of need had confirmed the law of Christians‚ (praying
Him) in the present battle to break the strength of the Saracens and
the devil, and to extend the kingdom of Christ and the Church
everywhere from sea to sea. Nor was there delay. God was present
with those who cried out to Him, and He administered such strength
of courage that any one who saw us rush upon the enemy might
have likened us to a sluggish stag thirsting for a fountain of running
water. It was, indeed, accomplished in marvelous manner, for in
our army there could not have been more than 5000 knights and
15‚ooo foot-soldiers ; in that of the enemy Ioo‚ooo knights and 400,000
foot-soldiers. Then marvelous did the Lord appear among His ser-
vants, since, before we carne into (actual) conflict, He turned this
