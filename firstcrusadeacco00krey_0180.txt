158 THE FIRST CRUSADE

from you—not only from you, but, also, from all the sons of the
Holy Mothcr Church of Rheims, in whom we have the greatest
saith. Likewise, inasmuch as you are our lord, and the counsel of
the whole kingdom of France is especially dependent upon you, we
are keeping you, father, informed of whatever happy and adverse
events have happened to ωε. Let the others, moreover, be informed
through you, that you may share equally in our sufferings, and re-
joice with us in our success.

We have informed you how we sared in the siege and capture
of Nicaea, in our departure thence and our journey through all
Romania and Armenia. It now remains for us to tell you 'a little
about the siege of Antioch, the many kinds of danger we there
tasted, and the innumerable battles which we fought against the
King of Aleppo, the King of Damascus, and against the adulterous
King of Jerusalem.30 ¹

Antioch has been besieged by the army of the Lord since
the thirteenth day before the Kalends of November with ex-
ceeding valor and courage beyond words. What unheard of
battles you might have perceived there at a certain gateway to the
west! How marvelous it would seem to you, were you present,
to see them daily rushing forth through six gates—both they and
ourselves fighting for safety and life! At that time our princes,
seeking to enclose the city more and more closely, first besieged the
eastern gate, and Bohemund, having built a fort there, stationed a
part of his army in it. However, since our princes then felt some-
what elated, God‚ who chasteneth every son whom he loveth, so
chastened us that hardly seven hundred horses could be found in our
army; and thus, not because we lacfked proven and valiant men,
but from lack of horses, or food, or through excessive cold, almost
all were dying. The Turks, moreover, supplied with horses and all
necessities in abundance, were wont daily to ride around our camp,
a certain stream which lay between serving as a wall. There was
likewise a castle of the Turks almost eight miles away; and these
Turks were daily killing many of our men, who were going back and
forth from our army. Our princes went out against them and with
God's help put them to flight and killed many of thern. Therefore
the 'ruler of Antioch, seeing himself afflicted, called the King of
Damascus to his aid. By God’s providence‚ this King met Bohemund
and the Count of Flanders, who had gone to find food with a part of
our army, and, God’s help prevailing, he was defeated and routed
by them. The ruler of Antioch, still concerned about his safety‚
sent to the King of Aleppo and aroused him with promises of very
great wealth, to the end that he should come with all his forces.
