THE FIRST CRUSADE 213

fearing that if he alone should determine the day of the journey,
the others would not go because of envy of him. Why say much?
The Count, overcome by the tears of the poor, named the fifth or
sixth day to be announced through the city t'or the journey, and
after this he returned to Antioch.

The Count with the Bishop sought a way to retain the city, and
who and how many men they could leave there as a garrison for
it. Meanwhile, the Count sent word to the Duke of Lor1·aine and
to the others who were not present at Marra to assemble in one
place and deal with the matters which would be necessary for the
march. And so they assembled at Ruso, which was about midway
between Antioch and Marra. There a colloquy was held and all the
princes behaved worse (than usual). For the princes excused them-
selves from the journey, and many others because of them. Never-
theless, the Count wished to give the Duke ten thousand solidi, an
equal amount to Robert of Nor-mandy, six thousand to the Count
of Flanders, and five thousand to Tancred, and to the other princes
accordingly.

In the midst of this, when the news came to the poor who had
remained at Marra that the Count wanted to leave many knights
and foot—soldiers of the army in the city of Marra as a garrison,
they said to one another, “Oho! quarrels about Antioch and quar-

there be contention among the princes, and a lessening ot' the arm)r
of God? Surely there will be no further argument about this city!
Come, andNet us destroy its walls, and peace will be made between
the princes and security for the Count, lest he lose it.''

Thereupon‚ the weak and sick arose from their beds, and, armed
with clubs they went to the walls. After those stones which three
or four yoke of oxen could scarcely drag had been rolled back, a
serf easily pushed them far out from the walls. But the Bishop of
Albara and other intimates of the Count went around the city com-
plaining and forbidding this to be done in any way. When, how-
ever, those guardians had passed, those who had hidden themselves
and climbed down at the approach of the Bishop and his compan-
ions, immediately returned to the work begun. And those who
dared not destroy by day, or could not, being otherwise engaged,
applied themselves (to the task) at night. There was scarcely any-
one os: the people too weak or ill to tear down the wall.

Meanwhile, there was such famine in the army that the people
ate most greedily the already fetid bodies of the Saracens which
they had cast into the swamp of the city two weeks and more ago.
These events frightened many of our people, as well as others. On‘
