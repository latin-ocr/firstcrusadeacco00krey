256 THE FIRsT CRUSADE

Although we have passed over many matters, this one we ought
to record. While we marched around the city in procession, the
Saracens and Turks made the circuit on the walls, ridiculing us in
many ways. They placed many crosses on the walls in yokes and
mocked them with blows and insulting deeds. We, in turn, hoping
to obtain the aid of God in storming the city by means of these
signs, pressed the work of the siege day and night.

3. Final assault and capture. (July 15, 1099.)

(Gesta.) At length, our leaders decided to beleaguer the city
with siege machines, so that we might enter and worship the Saviour
at the Holy Sepulchre. They constructed wooden towers and many
other siege machines. Duke Godfrey made a wooden tower and
other siege devices, and Count Raymond did the same, although
it was necessary to bring wood from a considerable distance. How-
ever, when the Saracens saw our men engaged in this work, they
greatly strengthened the fortifications of the city and increased the
height of the turrets at night. On a certain Sabbath night, the lead-
ers, after having decided which parts of the wall were weakest,
dragged the tower and the machines to the eastern side of the city.
Moreover‚ we set up the tower at earliest dawn and equipped and
covered it on the first, second, and third days of the week. The
Count of St. Gilles erected his tower on the plain to the south of
the city.

While all this was going on, our water supply was so limited
that no one could buy enough water for one denarius to satisfy
or quench his thirst. Both day and night, on the fourth and fifth
days of the week, we made a determined attack on the city from
all sides. However, before we made this assault on the city, the
bishops and priests persuaded all, by exhorting and preaching‚ to
honor the Lord by marching around Jerusalem in a great proces-
sion, and to prepare for battle by prayer, fasting, and almsgiving.
Early on the sixth day of the week we again attacked the city
on all sides, but as the assault was unsuccessful, we were all
astounded and fearful. However, when the hour approached on
which our Lord Jesus Christ deigned to suffer on the Cross for
us, our knights began to fight bravely in one of the towers-—namely‚
the party with Duke Godfrey and his brother, Count Eustace.¹³
One of our knights, named Lethold, clambered up the wall of the
city, and no sooner had he ascended than the defenders fled from
the walls and through the city. Our men followed, killing and slay-
ing even to the Temple of Solomon, where the slaughter was so
great that our men waded in blood up to their ankles.-·*
