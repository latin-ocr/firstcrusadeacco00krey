6. Bolzemmzd (md Baldwin fnlfil their vow. (November, 1099—
January‚ 1100.)

(Pulcher.) ...... Lord Bohemund, a wise and energetic man,
was then ruling in Antioch, while Baldwin, a brother 01 1116 31016-
said Godfrey, ruled Edessa and the neighboring lands across the
Euphrates river. When these two heard that Jerusalem had been
taken by those who had set out as their companions, they were made
most joyful and humbly gave thanks to God. But 11 111056 who pre—
ceded them had done well and successfully, it is not to be doubted
that these two, with their forces, were to partake 01 1116 glory, even
though they followed later. For it was necessary that the land
and states taken with such difficulty from the Turks should be
carefully guarded. These, 11 1611 unguarded‚ might be recovered
in a renewed attack by the Turks, who were now driven back to
Persia. In this case, great harm would befall all the Franks going
to Jerusalem, as well 35 returning. Perhaps Divine Providenoe,
knowing that Bohemund and Baldwin would be more 11561111 10 1116
army in what remained to be done than in what was already done,
had delayed them.

Oh, how many times, in the meantime, this same Baldwin was
wearied in making war against the Turks in the land 01 Mesopo-
tamia! To tell how many 01 their heads he cut off there would be
impossible. 011611 11 happened that he with his few men fought a
great multitude 01 1116111 311(1, with the help 01 God‚ rejoiced in
triumph. And when themund‚ through legates, had advised Bald-
win that they and their men should both complete the unfinished
journey to Jerusalem, Baldwin, arranging satisfactorily all his
affairs, prepared to go. Then, hearing that the Turks had invaded
one section 01 1115 country, he suspended the execution 01 1115 pro-
ject, and without taking time to assemble his little army, he went
against the enemy with a few men. On a certain day when the
Turks, uneoncerned in their tents‚ were thinking that Baldwin had
already commenced his journey, all at once they saw the white flag
which he carried 3 and, struck with 1631, they took to ssight. After
following them a little way with his few men, Baldwin returned to
complete what he had just planned. -

the pack animals and set out. It was the month 01 November.
