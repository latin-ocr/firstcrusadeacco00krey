266 THE FIRST CRUSADE

&Vlien Tancred heard this, he straightway sent a messenger to
Jerusalem to Duke Godfrey, the Patriarch, and all the princes,
saying: “Know that battle is being prepared for us at Ascalon.
Go there quickly with all the forces that you can obtain.'' Then the
Duke ordered that all be warned to go to Ascalon faithfully pre-
pared against our enemy. He himself, with the Patriarch and
Robert, Count of Flanders, went out of the city on the third day
of the week, and the Bishop of Martirano with them. But the Count
of St. Gilles and Robert the Norman said that they would not go
forth unless they knew that battle was certain. Accordingly, they
ordered their knights to go and see whether there was really a
battle, and to return quickly‚ because they were ready to go straight-

took plunder of many cattle, camels, sheep, and goods of all kinds.
However, almost th'ree hundred Arabs came up and our men rushed
upon thern and took two of thern, pursuing the rest up to their army.
When evening came, the Patriarch had it heralded through the
whole host that at earliest morning all should be ready for battle,
forbidding any man to pay attention to any spoils until the battle
was finished, but saying that when this was done they might return
with joy of good fortune to take all that was predestined to them
by the Lord.

At early dawn on the sixth day of the week, they entered a very
beautiful valley near the sea-coast, where they arranged their lines.
The Duke drew up his line, the Count of Normandy his, the Oount
of St. Gilles his, the Count of Flanders his, Tancred and Gastonw·

the knights ; and so they ordered everything and began to fight im-
