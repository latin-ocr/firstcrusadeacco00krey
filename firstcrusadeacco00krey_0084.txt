68 THE FIRST CRUSADE

failed uS, and we were detained in the midst of the billows. On
the fourth day, we reached land, about ten miles from the city
of Durazzo. Our fleet, however, anchored at two ports. Then
joyfully we again resumed the dry land and advanced beyond the
above mentioned city. So we passed by the regions of Bulgaria‚
over steep mountains and desert places. Then we all came to the
rapid river, called by the natives the River of the Demon,³⁰ and
appropriately so. For in this river we saw many people, who
hoped to wade across step by step, perish suddenly, engulfed by the
strong force of the torrent, and none of those looking on were able
to save them. NVherefore, moved by compassion, we shed many
tears, and had not knights with their mighty battle steeds brought
aid to the foot-soldiers, many of them would there have lost their
lives in the same manner. Then we pitched our tents near the
bank and there we spent one night. Great mountains, uninhabited,
were about us on all sides. Hardly had the morning dawned, when
the war trumpets sounded, and, resuming our way, we descended the
mountain called Bagora. Afterwards passing by the mountain and
the towns Ochrida, Bitolia, Wodena, and Stella,³1 we came to the
river called Vardar. And what could not usually be done except
by boat, we did by the help of God; we waded across. The day
following we camped before the city of Thessalonica, a city rich in
goods of all kinds, After a four days delay here, we travelled
through Macedonia,2through the valley of the Strymon, and through
Crisopolis and Chrislopolis, Praetoria,³² Messinopolis, Maera, Traia-
nopolis, Neapolis, Panedor, Rodosto, and Heraclea, Silivri, and
Naturaf'and we arrived at Constantinople. Pitching our tents be-
fore this city, we rested fourteen days.
