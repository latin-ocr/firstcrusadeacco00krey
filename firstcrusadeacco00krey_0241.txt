THE FIRST CRUSADE 219

abandon their fortress, and, in addition, attacked our squires and
foot-soldiers, who were unarmed and were running through the
villages for food. After having killed some, they took the spoils
into their fortress. Our men, therefore, went to the fortress in
anger. The peasants, however, hesitated to come against us at the
foot of the mountain on which the fortress was located. Then our
men, after taking counsel, drew up ranks of foot-soldiers and
knights, and, climbing to the top of the mountain from three sides,
they forced the body of peasants to fiee. There were about thirty
thousand Saracens, and their fortress was on the slope of a certain
very high mountain; besides, when they wished, they sought refuge
in the castle, and some higher up on the mountain. So they resisted
us for-a little while. At length, we shouted out the cry usual in
our straits, “God help us! God help us!'' Our enemy were so dis-
turbed that at the entrance of their castle upwards of a hundred
fell dead without wounds, because of fear and the rush of their
companions, There was, moreover, very great plunder of cattle,
horses, and sheep outside the castle where our people were engaged.
And while the Count and some knights were intent upon the battle,
our poor, after taking plunder, began to return, one after the other.
Next the poor foot-soldiers took the way, after thern the poor
knights. Moreover‚ our tents were some distance from the castle,
about ten miles. Meanwhile the Count ordered the knights and the
people to encamp. Then, when the Saracens who had climbed higher
on the mountain and those in the fortress saw that the greatest
portion of our men had left, they began to urge one another in turn
to join forces. But the Count overlooked this and found himself
almost abandoned by his knights. For the hill on which the fortress
stood was very steep and stony‚ and the path was a difficult one in
which one horse could scarcely follow another. Thereupon, when
the Count was caught in this difficulty, he began to advance with
his companions, as if to fight against those who were coming down
from higher up the mountain. The Saracens at first hesitated at
the approach of the Count; then our men changed their route and
descended into the valley, as if secure. Upon seeing themselves
frustrated, and that our men descended in security, the Saracens
from both the fortress and the mountain together attacked our forces.
Therefore, some of our men under compulsion dismounted from
their horses, and others went headlong over the steep rocks. So
with the greatest danger some escaped death, but others died fight-
ing bravely. This one fact we learned for certain: that the Count
never was in greater danger of his life. Therefore, angry at himself
and at his men, he called a council upon returning to the army and
