40 THE FIRST CRUSADE

since they were forced to make payments and tributes almost every
mile, to purchase release at every gate of the city, at the entrance
of the churches and temples, at every side-journey from place to
place: also, if any accusation whatsoever were made against them,
they were compelled to purchase their release: but if they refused to
pay money, the prefects of the 'Gentiles according to their custom‚
urged them fiercely with blows. What shall we say of those who
took up the journey without anything more than trust in their bar-
ren poverty, since they seemed to have nothing except their bodies
to lose? They not only demanded money of them, which is not an
unendurable punishment, but also examined the callouses of their
heels, cutting them open and folding the skin back, lest. perchance,
they had sewed something there. Their unspeakable cruelty was
carried on even to the point of giving them scammony to drink
until they vomited, or even burst their bowels, because they thought
the wretches had swallowed gold or silver; or, horrible to say, they
cut their bowels open with a sword and, spreading out the folds
of the intestines, with frightful mutilation disclosed whatever na-
ture held there in secret. Remember, I pray, the thousands who
have perished vile deaths, and strive for the holy places from which
the beginnings of your faith have come. Before you engage in His
battles, believe without question that Christ will be your standard-
bearer and inseparable fore-runner.''

The most excellent man concluded his oration and by the power
of the blessed Peter absolved all who vowed to go and confirmed
those acts with apostolic blessing. He instituted a sign well suited
to so honorable a profession by making the figure of the Cross,
the stigma of the Lord’s Passion, the emblem of the soldiery, or
rather, of what was to be the soldiery of God. This, made of
any kind of cloth‚ he ordered to be sewed upon the shirts, cloaks‚
and byrra of those who were about to go. He commanded that if
anyone, after receiving this emblem, or after taking openly this
vow, should shrink from his good intent through base change of
heart‚ or any affection for his parents, he should be regarded an
outlaw forever, unless he repented and again undertook whatever
of his pledge he had omitted. Furthermore, the Pope condemned
with a fearful anathema all those who dared to molest the wives,

children, and possessions of these who were going on this journey
for God. . . .
