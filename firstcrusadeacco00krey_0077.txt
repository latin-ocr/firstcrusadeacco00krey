THE FIRST CRUSADE 61

that land was given over in plunder to the alien pilgrims and
knights, who, delaying there for eight days, laid waste the whole
region.

But the Emperor, upon learning that the country had been laid
waste, sent to the Duke Rudolph Peeldelan and Rotger, son of
Dagobert, very eloquent men, who were of the region and kinship
of the Franks. He asked that the army should cease from plunder-
ing and devastating his realm; and he said that without delay he
would give back the captives whom the Duke demanded. Then the
Duke was pleased with the message of the Emperor; and, after en-

avenged by God. Many who had come thus far with us waited no
longer, but at once, with disgraceful cowardice, returned to their
homes. Ἣ

QNe, however, travelling through the center of Campagnia‚
reached Bari, a rich seaport town. There we addressed our sup-
plications to God in the church of St. Nicholas. Then coming to
port, we decided to cross at once. But because we lacked seamen,
and because fortune might play us false, and because, furthermore,
it was winter time, which exposed us to dangerS, Robert, Count of
