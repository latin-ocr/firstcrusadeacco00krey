THE FIRST CRUSADE 113

At Nicaea the various bands were formed into one army, and thereafter
the different authors serve to correct and corroborate one another in the
account of their common experiences. Two exceptions occur; one in re-
gard to the battle of Dorylaeum, when the army was temporarily divided,
and the other when Baldwin and Tancred left the main army on journeys
of adventure in Cilicia. The division of the army before Dorylaeum was
ended by the battle, and the digression of Baldwin to Edessa took him per-
manently from the main army, while that of Tancred ended when the main
army joined him before Antioch. Fulcher, who accompanied Baldwin, there-
fore ceases at this time to qualify as an eye-witness of events which oc-
curred in the main army. For Tancred’s separate acts the account by the
Anonymous may be supplemented by that of Raoul de Caen, who probably
gained his story from Tancred himself.1 ,Events followed one another in
such rapid succession as to confuse writers who delayed the composition of
their narratives for some time. This is especially true of Raymond, whose
story must be carefully checked by the letters and the Gesta. On most mat-
ters of importance in this chapter the accounts agree. The most notable
exception is that of the defection of the Greek commander Tetiyus, called
also Totis, Titidus, Tutunus, and Statinus. The divergent view of Anna de-

serves consideration in view of the increased distrust between the Latins
and the Greeks.²)

Ι. Battle of Dorylaeszn. (July 1, 1097.)

(Gesta.) -Then on the first day after leaving the city, we came
to a certain bridge and remained there for two days. On the third
day, however, before day had begun to dawn, our men arose. Since
it was night, they were unable to keep to one road, but were divided
into two lines and, thus divided, proceeded for two days, In one
line were the men, Bohemund, Robert of Normandy, the renowned
Tancred, and several others; in the other were the Count of St.
Gilles, Duke Godfrey, the Bishop of Puy, Hugh the Great, the
Count of F landers‚ and many others. But on the third day the Turks
rushed violently upon Bohemund and those who were with him.
Forthwith the Turks began to whistle and chatter and shout at the
top of their voices, uttering a diabolica] sound, Ι know not how, in
their own tongue. The wise man, Bohemund, seeing innumerable
Turks whistling and shouting from afar with demoniacal voices,
straightway ordered all the knights to dismount and quickly pitch
their tents. Before the tents had been pitched, he spoke again to
all the knights: “Seignors and bravest knights of Christ, behold
the battle is now close about us on all sides. Therefore, let all the
knights advance manfully against the enemy, and let the foot-
soldiers spread the tents carefully and very quickly.” But after
this was all done, the Turks were already encircling us on all sides,
slashing, hurling, piercing, and shooting far and wide in wondrous ,
