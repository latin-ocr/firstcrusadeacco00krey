THE FIRST CRUSADE 227

“And Ι said, “What are we to do about the incredulous?'

“The Lord, answered, ‘Spare them not, kill them; for they are
my betrayers, brothers of Judas Iscariot. But give their possessions
to those who are of the first rank, according to their needs. If you
do this, you will find the right way, which you have thus far gone
around. And just as the other things which thou hast prophesied
happened unchanged in the future, this also will occur. Dost thou
know which people Ι love especially ?’

“And Ι replied‚ ‘The race of the Jews.’

“The Lord said, *These people I hold in hate, because they were
unbelievers and Ι have placed them below all peoples. See, there-
fore, that you are not unbelievers. Otherwise Ι will take up other
peoples, while you remain with the Jews; and through them Ι will
fulfil' what I promised you. Say this also to them (the army):
“Why do you fear to do justice? And what is better than justice ?’'
I want them to keep the following justice. Let thern place judges
by families and relatives. When, moreover, anyone shall offend
another, let him who suffered the wrong say: “Brother, dost thou
wish it to be done thus with thee ?’' After this, unless the offender
shall desist, let the other oppose him in the name of his authority.
Then let the judge freely take all his goods from the malefactor,
and the half of all that has been taken let him give to the one who
suffered this wrong, the remaining part to the authorities. If, how-
ever, the judge should defer this for any reason, go to him and say
that if he does not correct himself, he will not be absolved even at
the last day, unless thou dost release him. Dost thou know how
serious a matter it is to be forbidden? For I forbade Adam to
touch the tree of good and evil knowledge; he transgressed my
prohibition and both he and his posterity were in wretched captivity
until Ι came in the flesh and redeemed thern by dying the death of
the Cross. verny, some have done well about the tithe‚ because
they gave it as I commanded. Therefore, Ι will multiply them,
and I will make them known among the others.'

“Moreover‚ when the Lord had said this, Ι began to ask Him out
of His kindness to give back the knowledge of letters which He
had recently taken from me.

“And the Lord said to me, ‘Are the things that thou knowest not
enough to tell this? And yet thou desirest to know as much as
possiblel’

“And forthwith I seemed to myself so wise that Ι would ask
nothing further.

“Then the Lord said, ‘Is what thou knowest enough for this ?’

“I replied‚ ‘It is.’
