226 THE FIRST CRUSADE

Me thus. Dost thou see these, My five wounds? Thus do you con-
sist of five ranks. The first rank is the rank of those who do not
sear javelins and swords, or any kind of engine. That rank is like
unto Me, for I went to Jerusalem and did not fear swords and
lances, cudgels and staves, or, in addition, the Cross. They die for
Me; and Ι died for them; and Ι am in them, and they in Me. NVhen
such as these die, they are placed on the right hand of God, where
after the resurrection I sat, having ascended to heaven. The sec-
ond is the rank of those who are a help to the first3 but they guard
them from the rear, and to thern the former also come for refuge;
verily, these are like the apostles who followed Me and ate with Me.
The third is the rank of those who bring stones and javelins to the
first; they are like those who, when they saw Me placed on the
Cross, bemoaning my Passion, beat their breasts, proclaiming that
wrong had been done Me. The fourth, indeed, is the rank of those
who, upon seeing the battle surge, push themselves into houses and
turn to their own affairs, trusting that victory rests not in My might,
but in human worth. They are like those who said “He is worthy
of death; let Him be crucified; since He makes Himself a king and
says that He is the Son of God.’' The fifth, however, is the rank
of those who, when they hear the shout of battle, look on from
afar, asking the cause of the outcry, and afford examples of coward-
ice, not of bravery‚ and are unwilling to undergo dangers not only
for Me, but, likewise, for their brothers. Under the form of avoid-
ing (danger), they want others to fight, or bring arms to the fighters‚
and they feast at looking on3 they are like Judas the Betrayer and
Pontius Pilate, the judge.'

“Moreover, the Lord was naked upon the Cross‚ encircled only
with a linen eloth from knees to loins, and the linen eloth was of a
color midway between red and black. And about His ears He had
a white, red, and green head-band. Later, when the Cross had been
taken away, the Lord remained in the garb which He wore before.

“And I said to Him, ‘Lord, God, if I say this, they will not be-
lieve me.'

“The Lord replied to me, ‘Dost thou want to recognize those who
will not believe this ?’

“And I said, ‘Yea, Lord.'

“And the Lord answered, ‘Let the Count assemble the princes
and people, and let thern make arrangements about the battles, or
when it shall be time for the siege of the fortress. Let the most
renowned herald proclaim “God help us!’' thrice, and let him strive
to carry out the arrangements. Then as I have told thee, thou wilt
see these ranks: and together with the others who believe this thou
wilt distinguish the unbelievers.'
