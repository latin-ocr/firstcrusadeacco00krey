THE FIRST CRUSADE 93

ever, I advise you not to place yourself either among those who
bring up the rear line of battle or among those who precede the
standards‚ but that you take a place between the first and last
ranks. For Ι know from long experience the manner of fighting
among the Turks.'’

And he gave this salutary advice not only to him, but also to all
the others, to whom he told what was about to happen‚ urging
strongly that they should not pursue the Turks too eagerly, since by
the will of God they would conquer these barbarians anyway. He
urged, also, that they should look out for ambushes, lest they fall
into them and be killed. So much may be said about Godfrey and
Raoul and the others following them.

5. Bolzemnnd and tlte Emperor. (April Io-May, 1097.)

(Gesta.) When the Emperor heard that the most honorable
man, Bohemund‚ had come to him, he commanded that he be re-

had been so lodged, the evil Emperor sent for him to come to speak
with him in secret. Thither, also, came Duke Godfrey with his
