32 THE FtRsr CRUsADE

death, has glorified by burial. This royal city, therefore, situated
at the center of the world, is now held captive by His enemies, and
is in subjectior} to those who do not know God, to the worship of
the heathen. Therefore, she seeks and desires to be liberated and
does not cease to implore you to come to her aid. From yon, espe-
cially, she asks succor, because, as we have already said, God has
conferred upon you, above all nations, great glory in arms. Ac-
cordingly, undertake this journey for the remission ot' your sins,
with the assurance of the imperishable glory of the kingdom of
heaven.’'

When Pope Urban had said these and very many similar things
in his urbane discourse, he so influenced to one purpose the desires
of all who were present that they cried out, “God wills it! God
wills it!'’ When the venerable Roman pontiff heard that, with eyes
uplifted to heaven he gave thanks to God and, with his hand corn-
manding silence, said:

“Most beloved brethren‚ to—day is manifest in you what the Lord
says in the Gospel, ‘where two or three are gathered together in
My name there am Ι in the midst of the1n.'²O Unless the Lord God
had been present in your minds, all of you would not have uttered

Let this then be your battle-cry in combat, because this word is
given to you by God. XVhen an armed attack is made upon the
enemy, let this one cry be raised by all the soldiers of God: ‘God
wills it! God wills itl'

“And we do not command or advise that the old, or the feeble,
or those unfit for bearing arms, undertake this journey; nor ought
women to set out at all without their husbands, or brothers, or legal
guardians. For such are more of a hindrance than aid, more of a
burden than an advantage. Let the rich aid the needy; and, ac-
cording to their means, let thern take with them experienced sol-
diers. The priests and clerks of any order are not to go without
the consent of their bishops; for this journey would profit thern
nothing if they went without such permission. Also, it is not fitting
that laymen should enter upon the pilgrimage without the blessing
of their priests.

“Whoever‚ therefore, shall determine upon this holy pilgrimage
and shall make his vow to God to that effect and shall offer himself
to Him as a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, shall wear
the sign of the cross of the Lord on his forehead, or on his breast.
When, having truly fulfilled his vow, he wishes to return, let him
