THE FIRST CRUSADE 235

in accord under him as leadcr. All the cities will surrender to him,
and he will invest those he wishes, and ‹lestroy those he wishes.
Resides, if these people of ours‚ assailed by long and daily trials,
should come to Jerusalem, they would wish to go home, perchance,
after having seen it from the outside. Consider carefully the
dangers and very great dangers which remain for those who desire
to finish the journey. Resides this, moreover, let us besiege 1116
10111655 01 Archas, and it will surrender within a month, or be cap-
tured by force. When people at a distance learn of this siege, if
we abandon it as impossible, our army, which hitherto has under-
taken nothing that it has not finished, will be much despised.’'
’ But others said on the other hand, “The Emperor has always
done us 111111, 1135 always lied, has always plotted against us. And
now because he sees that 116 can do nothing, and that we are victo-
rious through the grace of God, he zealously strives to draw us off
from the proposed journey, lest those who will 11631 01 11 arrange
to follow our example. But now let those whom he has so often
hurt by word and deed take care not to place trust in him in vain.
Putting our faith, therefore, in Christ our Leader, who 1135 116-
livered 115 110111 50 many dangers beyond expectation, and who has
preserved 115 against all the efforts and wiles 01 1116 Emperor, let 115
proceed on the journey for which we came; and by God’s promise
we will easily accomplish what we wish. When the Emperor shall
hear that Jerusalem has been captured and the road 15 1166, 116 will
fulfil in deed what he 1135 feigned in words. It will be likewise
with the gifts.'' The people approved this opinion most. But be-
cause the friends of the Count were many, the Count would surely
have exposed himself with his people to death without the other
princes, and he would have given large individual gifts to many,
had not the counsel of the princes and the votes of the people pre—
vented.

At this time we preached a fast, prayers, and alms 10 1116 060016,
11131 Almighty God, who had led them hither from so many regions,
should deign 10 breathe into them which 01 111656 (0011110115) was
pleasing in His sight. And thus the prayers 01 1116 1311111111 easily
obtained from God what they sought. For the Bishop of Puy ap-
peared to Stephen Valentine‚ whom we mentioned above, the one
who saw the Lord with the Cross, and, beating ¹him with a switch
as he was returning to his home by night, said to him, “Stephen.”
He replied, “Sire,’' and looking back, he recognized him.

The Bishop said, “Why hast thou time and again neglected what
I said to thee about the Cross of the Lord and our Mother, Virgin
Mary? Ι commanded that the Cross which Ι was accustomed to
