THE FIRST CRUSADE 233

out· 61161111651 Indeed, we did not believe that any arrow could pass
unhurt through the 1116, 35 11115 111311 passed through !'’

After this Peter called the chaplain of the Coum, Raymond, by
name, to him and said, “Why did you wish me to pass through 1116
101· proof of the Lance 01 1116 Lord and 011161· things that Ι reported
as from God? Ι know well that you have thought this way and
that.”

And he told me what 116 had thought. But when Raymond de-
nied that he had so thought, Peter Bartholomew replied, “Yon can
not deny it to me, since Ι know it 101 66113111, because the other
night the most Blessed Virgin Mary was here and the Bishop of
Puy, through whom I learned the things which you deny. Since
you did not doubt the words 01 1116 Lord and His apostles, Ι wonder,
indeed, why you should wish, at my risk, to hold trial about these
matters alone.”

Then Raymond, seeing his thought detected and himself culp-
able before God, broke forth most bitterly in tears. And Peter
thereupon said: “Do not despair for 1116 111051 Β1655611 Virgin Mary
and St. Andrew will obtain pardon for you with God. But you must
be more zealous in beseeching them.”

Meanwhile, 50 many and such great disputes arose between the
leaders 01 our army 11131 almost the whole army was divided. But
God, who was our Guide and Master, forbade such (an end) 10 be-

Accordingly, when the lord 01 11115 city learned 01 1116 (11560111 be—
tween our princes, he replied as follows to our 111611 who called upon
him about paying tribute: “And who are the Franks? And what
kind 01 knights are they? And how great is their power? Behold
it is now the third month since the army 01 1116 Franks besieged
Archas, and Ι have seen neither an assault of theirs nor any armed
man, and yet they are only four leagues away. But let them come
hither‚ and let us see thern and prove their military skill. Why
should Ι become tributary to these men whose faces I have not seen,
and whose bravery Ι do not know ?” As this was reported to our
army, 501116 said to one another, “Behold what we have gained by
our quarrels and discord! God is blasphemed and we are despised !”
For this cause, therefore, our princes came to agreement and decided
that the Bishop 01 Albara should guard the camp with a part 01 1116
army3 and, as was their manner of fighting, that the princes with
the ranks 01 1001-501111615 and knights should attack the walls 01
1116 city.

However, on the appointed day when our men thus set forth, the
people 01 Tripoli, relying on the multitude of their number, came
