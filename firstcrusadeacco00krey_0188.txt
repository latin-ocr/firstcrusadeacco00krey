Turks.’' And thus he put an end to his words.

The mother of the same Curbara, who dwelt in the city of Alepp0‚
came immediately to him and, weeping, said: ‘'Son, are these things
true which I hear ?”

“What things ?'' he said.

“I have heard that you are going to engage in battle 1111111 1116 host
01 1116 Franks,” she replied.

And he answered: “You know the truth fully.”

She then said, “1 warn you, son, in the names of all the gods
and by your great kindness, not to enter into battle with the Franks,
because you are an unconquered knight‚ and Ι have never at all
heard 01 any imprudence from you or your army. No one has
ever found you fleeing from the field before any victor. The fame
01 your army is spread abroad, and all illustrious knights tremble-
when your name is heard. For we know well enough, son, that you
are mighty in battle, and valiant and resourceful, and that no host
of Christians or pagans 6311 113116 any courage before your face, but
are wont to fiee at the mention 01 your name, as sheep fiee before
the wrath of a lion. And so Ι beseech you, dearest son, to yield

emirs than there are Christians, whether of greater or lesser state.’'

His mother replied to him: “O sweetest son, the Christians'
cannot fight with your forces, for I know that they are not able
to prevail against you; but their God is fighting for them daily and
is watching over them and defending them with His protection by
day and night, as a shepherd watches over his flock. He does not
permit them to be hurt or disturbed by any folk, and whoever
seeks to stand in their way this same God of theirs likewise puts to
rout, just 35 Η6 said through the mouth of the prophet David:
‘Scatter the people that delight in wars,’ and in another place:
‘Pour out Thy wrath upon the nations that know Thee not and ,
against the kingdoms that call not upon Thy name.'³ Before they
are ready to begin battle, their God, all powerful and potent in
battle, together with His saints, has all their enemies already con· -
quered. How much more will He now prevail against you, who
are His enemies, and who are preparing to resist thern with all your ,ἶ
valor! This, moreover‚ dearest, know in very truth: these Chris· '⁶'
