THE FIRST CRUSADE 175

oath, then the Count ot' Ξῖ. Gilles, Robert of Normandy, Duke God-
frey, and the Count of Flanders. Tancred, indeed, swore and
promised in this manner: that as long as he had forty knights with
him he would not only not withdraw from that battle, but, likewise,
not from the march to Jerusalem. Moreover, the Christian assem-
blage exulted greatly upon hearing this oath. .
There was a certain pilgrim ot* our army, whose name was
Geter, to whom before we entered the city St. Andrew, the apostle‚
appeared and said: “What art thou doing, good man ?’'

Peter answered‚ “Who art thou ?’'

The apostle said to him: “I am Ξῖ. Andrew, the apostle. KnOW‚
my son, that when thou shalt enter the town, go to the church
of St. Peter. There thou wilt find the Lance of our Saviour, Jesus
Christ, with which He was wounded as He hung on the arm of the
cross.’' Having said all this, the apostle straightway withdrew.

But Peter, afraid to reveal the advice of the apostle, was unwilling
to make it known to the pilgrims. However, he thought that he had
seen a vision, and said: “Lord, who would believe this ?’' But at
that hour St. Andrew took him and carried him to the place where
the Lance was hidden in the ground. When we were a second time
situated in such (straits) as we have stated above, Ξῖ. Andrew
came again, saying'to him: “Wherefore hast thou not yet taken
the Lance from the earth as Ι commanded thee? Know, verily‚ that
whoever shall bear this lance in battle shall never be overcome
by an enemy.'' Peter, indeed, straightway made known to our men
the mystery of the apostle.

The people, however, did not believe (it), but refused, saying:
“How can we believe this ?” For they were utterly terrified and
thought that they were to die forthwith. 'Thereupon, this man
carne forth and swore that it was all most true, since Ξῖ. Andrew
had twice appeared to him in a vision and had said to him: “Rise,
go and tell the people of God not to sear, but to trust firmly with
whole heart in the one true God and they will be everywhere vic-
torious Within five days the Lord will send thern such a token
that they will remain happy and joyful‚ and if they wish to fight,
let them go out immediately to ba-‚ttle all together, and all their
enemies will be conquered, and no one will stand against them”
Thereupon, when they heard that their enemies were to be over-
come by them, they began straightway to revive and to encourage
one another, saying: “Bestir yourselves‚ and be everywhere brave

and alert, since the Lord will corne to our aid in the next

battle and will be the greatest refuge to His people whom He Ι]
beholds lingering in sorrow.'' ι
