THE FIRST CRUSADE 127

makes that on the west the river, flowing against the lower wall,
leaves a certain portion of land in the form ot' a bow between it
and the city. The city, situated in this manner on the east, rises up
toward the east, and within its embrace are enclosed the crests of
three mountains. That mountain, indeed, which is located on the
north is divided from the others by a very great precipice‚ so that
no access, or rather a most difficult one, is afforded from it to the
others. Moreover, on the northern hill there is a certain castle; on
the middle hill another castle, which is called in Greek Colax, and
on the third hill only towers. Moreover, this city, two miles in
length, is so fortified by walls, towers‚ and fore-walls that it {ears
the attack of no machine and the assault of no man, even if every
race of man should come together against it.

This city, such as we have described, this well fortified city, the
army of the Franks besieged from the northern side. Nevertheless‚
though there were one hundred thousand men in the army, they
made no assault there except that they pitched their camp near it.
There were, furthermore, in the city two thousand of the best'
knights, and four or five thousand common knights, and ten
thousand and more footmen. Indeed, these very lofty walls were
fortified by a valley and swamp, so that, the gates being guarded, the
rest remained secure. When we first came we pitched camp
so rashly that if our practice had been known by the enemy be-
forehand‚ any part of our camp could have been destroyed by
them, since in our army no regular method of watches or encamp-
ing was observed. It happened, also, that all the castles⁴ of this
region and the neighboring cities had surrendered to our men, not
only from sear of our army, but also for the sake of escaping
Turkish servitude. This fact scattered our knights widely; for each
one, wanting to look after his own affairs most, thought nothing of
the common interest. Meanwhile, those who remained in the camp
had such an abundance of food that they (lid not care to eat any-
thing ‘except the thighs and the shoulders of cattle, and only a few
were willing to eat the breast; but of grain and wine nothing is to
be said, except that they were taken most lightly.

While this was going on in the camp, the enemy at first hid
themselves within the walls, so that no one was seen there except
the watehmen. However, when they learned that our rnen, scattered
and unarmed, were devastating the villages and fields, the enemy
came, I know not whether from Antioch or from another city
two days distant, and began to kill our men whom they found thus
straggling and unarmed. These acts diminished the food supply
in our camp somewhat. The enemy, indeed, beset the roads much
too fiercely for any chance of robbery and destruction.
