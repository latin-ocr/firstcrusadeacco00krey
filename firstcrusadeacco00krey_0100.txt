82 THE FIRST CRUSADE

hold, were it not that many evil rumors‚ which have come to my
ears regarding you, have terrified me. However, Ι know not
whether these reports have been invented and spread about from
envy or malice towards you.'' The Emperor, hearing this, warmly
protested his innocence of all these charges, saying that never should
the Duke or any of his followers fear any artifice on his part, but
that he would serve and honor the Duke as his son, and the Duke’s
associates as his friends. Then the messengers of the Duke, on
their return, reported favorably on all the good and faithful prom-
ises which they had heard from the Emperor's lips But the Duke,
still placing little faith in the honeyed promises of the Emperor,
again refused him a conference. And so, between these messages
back and forth, fifteen days rolled away.

Therefore the Emperor, recognizing the firmness of the Duke
and that he could not be lured before him, again took offense and
withdrew the privilege of buying barley‚ and fish, and then bread‚
so that the Duke, thus coerced‚ could not refuse to enter the pres-

had been sounded at this command of the Duke, all rushed to arms.
They laid waste the buildings and towers in which they had been
lodged, setting fire to some, pulling others to pieceS, thus causing
irreparable damage to Constantinople.

Finally, when the report of this great fire and destruction had
reached the palace, the Duke became excessively alarmed, fearing
that when the flaming buildings and the noise of a moving army
had been noticed‚ the knights and archers of the Emperor would
suddenly seize the bridge over which they had come from the city
of ›Constantinople to the palatial residences. Therefore, without
delay he sent Baldwin, his brother, with five hundred armored
knights to seize the bridge‚ lest any force of the Emperor, an-
ticipating him, should destroy it, and thus deny the pilgrims pas-
sage back and forth.

Baldwin had scarcely taken a stand on the middle of the bridge‚
when, behold, from right and left, Turcopoles (the soldiers of the
