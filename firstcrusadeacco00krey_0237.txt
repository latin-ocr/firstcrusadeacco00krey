THE FIRST CRUSADE 215

their spoils in a certain fortified place called Cafardan, a journey
four leagues distant from Marra, and those who had companions
at Marra returned with the Count.

3. Raymond finally starts for Jerusalem. Arclzas. (January 13-
March, 1099.)

(Gesta.) When Raymond‚ moreover, saw that because of him
none of the leaders would go upon the way to the Holy Sepulchre,
he went out with bare feet from Marra on the thirteenth day ot' in-
coming January and came up to Cafardan and remained there for
three days. There the Count of Normandy joined Count Raymond.
Moreover‚ the xKing of Caesrea had very often sent word by his
messengers to the Count at Marra and Cafardan that he wished
to have peace with him and would give him a tribute from his own
(possessions)‚ and that he would cherish the Christian pilgrims.
He would make a pledge that the pilgrinis would not suffer the
least offence, as far as his sway extended‚ and he would joyfully
supply a market of horses and bodily nourishment.

Our men, moreover‚ left and went to lodge near Caesarea, above
the river Orontes. And when the King of Caesarea saw the camp
of the Franks lodged so near his city, he was grieved in spirit and
ordered the market to be denied them, unless they withdrew from
the neighborhood ot' the city. Eut on the next day he sent along
with them two Turks‚ his messengers, to show them the ford of
the river, and to conduct them where they could find something to
take. Finally they came to a valley below a certain fortress, and
there they took plunder of more than five thousand animals and
enough grain and other goods with which the whole army of Christ
was greatly refreshed. At length, that fortress surrendered to the
Count and gave him horsesand the purest gold, and they swore by
their law that no evil would henceforth be done to the pilgrims.
We were there for five days.

Departing thence, we carne to a lodge at a certain Arab fortress.
Thereupon, the lord of the place came out and made an agreement
with the Count. Going on from this place, we came to a certain
very beautiful city located in a valley filled with goods of all kinds
—Raphania by name. But when the inhabitants of the place heard
that the Franks had come, they abandoned the city, gardens filled
with olives, and houses full of food, and fled. On the third day we
went forth from the city and, passing over a high and immense
mountain, entered the valley of Desem, in which there was the-
greatest abundance of all goods, and we were there for about fifteen
days.
