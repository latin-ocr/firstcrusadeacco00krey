NOTES 299

28 This insistent plea, that the able-bodied who had taken the vow, and had
failed to carry it out, or had faltered on the way should fulfil their vows,
has appeared in practically all the letters written by the Crusaders since the
capture of Antioch. The papal command to the same effect must have been,
therefore, a real consolation to the many who had carried out their vow at
such great eost. It seems only an act of bare justice to set down the fate
of the two most prominent offenders, Stephen of Blois and Hugh the Great,
whose conduct involved not merely the ignominy of negligence but more
especially that of desertion in the face of the enemy. The following pas-
sage from Ordericus Vitalis (X, 19) as translated by Thomas Forester
(Bohn Antiquarian Library) reveals the embarrassing directness of the
pressure upon Stephen.

“Being frequently reproved by a variety of persons for this conduct,
Stephen was compelled both by fear and shame to undertake a fresh crusade.
Among others, his wife, Adele, often urged him to it, reminding him of it
even amidst *the endearments of conjugal caresseS. ‘Far be it from me, my
lord,’ she said, ‘to submit any longer to the jibes you receive from all
quarters. Pluck up the courage for which you were renowned in your
youth, and take arms in a noble cause for the salvation of fflousands, so
that Christians may have good reason to exult in all parts of the world, to
the terror of the pagans and the public humiliation of their detestable re-
ligion.'

“This was the sort of language that elever and spirited woman often ad-
dressed to her husband. He certainly had already sufficiently experienced
the perils and difficulties of the enterprise to make him shrink from under-
going such toils again. At length, however, he took courage, and, putting
himself on the march at the head of many thousand Freneh, persevered
against most formidable obstacles, until he reached the tomb of our Lord.”

Stephen survived but a very short time. He had visited Jerusalem and
was at Joppa, waiting for a ship to take him home, when news was brought
that hos-tile bands were in the vicinity. Baldwin, the king, called for volun-
teers to drive thern off and Stephen was among those who responded. The
battle was very disastrous for the Christians. To quote Fulcher’s words,
“Alas, how many valiant knights and how many brave soldiers we lost in
this catastrophe . . ‚1 For Stephen of Blois‚ a prudent and noble man, and
another Stephen, Count of Burgundy, were killed.”

There is a lack of agreement among the writers as to the fate of Hugh
the Great. That he was among the victims of this expedition is accepted by
Fulcher, who fixes his death at Tarsus late in 1101, and by William of Tyre
(X, 13), who states that his body was buried in the church of St. Paul at
that place.

2⁹ The offspring of these mixed marriages were called Pulloni and figure
prominently in the literature of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.

3⁰ This led to the formation of a mongrel speech known generally as the
Linyua Franca, which was long used in commercial intercourse throughout

the East.
