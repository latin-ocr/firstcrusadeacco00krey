THE FIRST CRUSADE 245

and loyal friend to thy vassals. If thou 511311 (10 this, (iod will grant
thee Jerusalem and Alexandria and Babylon. But 11 thou dost not
do this, thou shalt neither acquire the things promised by (iod nor
have a message‚ until thou art placed in such straits that 111011
knowest not how to escape!'” So the Count accepted the words
01 1110 911051; 110 accepted them, truly, in words, but he refused
them in deeds. For when he had received great wealth from the
King 01 Tripoli, he was never willing to give anyone any 01 11,
but he even daily afflicted his people with blows and insults. Not
only this, however, did that priest tell us, but also many other things,
some 01 which we have added to this work.

For once, when we wanted to set out from Antioch, that priest
031110 10 1110, Raymond‚ and said to me that a certain person had
appeared to him in a vision who said to him, “Go into the 011111011
01 St. Leontius, and thou wilt find there the relics 01 10111 5311115;
take them with thee and carry them to Jerusalem.’' And he showed
him in that vision the relies and locations 01 1110 101105, 31111 110
taught him the names 01 1110 saints. When that priest had awakened,
not fully believing in his vision, he began 10 urge God with prayers
and entreaties to make known to him a second time 11 11115 vision
was from Him. Several days later the 531110 saint stood before him
in a vision and threatened him much because he had neglected
the command 01 God, and (said that) unless he had taken those
relics away by the fifth day 01 1110 week, it would be 3 great hurt
to him and his 10111, C'ount Ysoard. Ysoard, Count 01 Die, was a
111311 loyal to God as 131 35 110 knew, and helpful to all 01 115 101 1115
wisdom and uprightness.

When the priest had narrated this to me, Raymond‚ Ι told it
to the Bishop 01 Orange and to the Count 01 St. Gilles and to some
others. We took candles and went to the church 01 St. Leontus‚
We offered the candles and vows 10 God and to the saints 01 the
same church, (praying) that Almighty God, who had sanctified
thern, might give them to us as companions and helpers; and that
those saints might not spurn the company 01 pilgrims and exiles
101· God, but, rather, out 01 charity might join us and link us with
God. When it became morning, we went with the priest to the
places where the relies were kept, and we 10111111 everything just
as it had been 101010111. Μο1001101, these are the names 01 1110 saints:
Cypriam, Omechios, Leontius, John (Ξ111γ50510111.5 And, further-
more, at the place where the relics were kept we found 3 little 011051
filled with relies. When he asked a priest about these, 01 which saint
they were the relies, he replied that he did not know. But when
we inquired 01 1110 inhabitants 11 they knew 01 which saint these
