160 THE FIRST CRUSADE

were, set a trap for us in which XValo, the Constable, and others
of them as well as of us were destroyed. A few days after this,
moreover, it was announced to us that Εονῖ)ανα,31 chief of the army
of the king of the Persians, had sworn to our death, and had already
crossed the great Euphrates river with an innumerable army. dod,
however, who does not desert those who place their trust in isim,
did not abandon His people, but on the Nones of June compas-
sionately gave to us the city of Anffioch, which three of its citizens
betrayed. W'e, however, devastated the city, and on that same (lay
killed all the pagans in it, except some who were holding out in the

castle of the city

(lee Crusoclings Princes). To the venerable lord Pope Urban,
Bohemund and Raymond, Count of St. Gilles, Godfrey, Duke of
Lorraine, Robert, Count of Normandy‚ Robert, Count of Flanders
and Eustace, Count of Boulogne; greeting and loyal service and,
as sons of their spiritual father, true subjection in Christ.

We all wish and desire that it be made known to you how, by the
compassion of God and by His most manifest assistance, Antioch has
been captured by us, and how the Turks, who had hurled many in-
sults at our Lord Jesus Christ, have been captured and killed:
how we, pilgrims of Jesus Christ on our way to Jerusalem, have
avenged the wrong against Most High God; how we, who were at
first besieging the Turks, were later besieged by Turks coming from
Chorosan, Jerusalem, Damascus, and many other lands; and how,
by the compassion of Jesus Christ, we have been liberated.

Accordingly, when, after the capture of Nicaea, we had defeated
that very great multitude of Turks which met us, as you have
heard, in the valley of Dorylaeum on the Kalends of July, and
had put that great Soliman to flight, despoiled his land and all his
possessions, and had acquired and pacified all Romania, we went
to besiege Antioch. In this siege we suffered very many ills,
especially from battles with the neighboring Turks and pagans, who
rushed upon us so often, and in such numbers, that we might more
truly have been spoken of as besieged by those whom we were
besieging in Antioch. Nevertheless, when we had won 311 these
battles, the Christian faith being greatly exalted by their outcome,
I, Bohemund, by an agreement made with a certain Turk‚ who
betrayed the city itself to me, shortly before daybreak, placed
scaling ladders against the wall with the help of many soldiers of
Christ. Accordingly, on the third day before the Nones of June,
we took the city, which before this time was resisting Christ.
Cassianus himself, the tyrant of the city, we killed, together with
