THE FIRST CRUSADE 181

of the Church of St. Peter, twelve men, together with that man who
had spoken of the Lance, began to dig. There were, moreover, among
those twelve men the Bishop of Orange, and Raymond, chaplain of
the Count, who has written this, and the Count himself, and Pontius
of Balazun, and Feraldus of Thouars. And after we had dug from
morning to evening, some began to despair of finding the Lance.
The Count left, because he had to guard the castle; but in place of
him and the rest who were tired out from digging, we induced
others, who were fresh to continue the work sturdily. The youth
who had spoken of the Lance, however, upon seeing us worn out,
disrobed and, taking off his shoes, descended into the pit in his shirt,
earnestly entreating us to pray God to give us His Lance for the
comfort and victory of His people. At length, the Lord was minded
through the grace of His mercy to show us His Lance. And I, who
have written this, kissed it when the point alone had as yet appeared
above ground. Vlshat great joy and exultation then filled the city

day before the Kalends of July.

On the second night, St. Andrew appeared to the youth through

has given to the Count that which he never wished to give to anyone
and has made him standard-beares of this army, as long as he shall
continue in His love.”

When the youth asked mercy from him for the people, St. Andrew
replied to him that verily would the Lord show mercy to His people.
And, again, when he asked the same saint about his companion, who
it was he had so often seen with him, St. Andrew answered‚ “Draw
near and kiss His foot.”

And so, when he was about to draw near, he saw a wound on
His foot as fresh and bloody as if it had just been made. When,
however, he hesitated to draw near because of the wound and blood,
St. Andrew said to him:

“Behold, the Father who was wounded on the Cross for us,
whence this wound. The Lord likewise commands that you cele-
brate that day on which He gave you His Lance. And since it was
found at vespers‚ and that day cannot be celebrated, celebrate the
solemn festival on the eighth day in the following week, and then
each year on the day of the finding of the Lance. Say, also, to
them that they conduct themselves as is taught in the Epistle of my
brother, Peter, which is read to-day.’' (And the Epistle was this:
“Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God.”)³ “Let the
clerics sing this hymn before the Lance: Lustra sex qui jam per-
acta tempus implens corporis. And when they shall have said,
