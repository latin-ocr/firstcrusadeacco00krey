102 THE FIRST CRUSADE

turned in flight, and most of them were killed. They came back
again, reinforced by others, joyful and exulting in assured (out-
come) of battle, and bearing along with them the ropes with which
to lead us bound to Chorosan. Coming gladly, moreover, they be-
gan to descend from the erest of the mountain a short distance.
As many as descended remained there with their heads cut off at
the hands of our men; moreover, our men hurled the heads of the
killed far into the city, that they (the Turks) might be the more
terrified thereat. Then the Count of St. Gilles and the Bishop of
Puy took counsel together as to how they might have undermined
a certain tower which was opposite their tents. Men were assigned
to do the digging, with arbalistae1⁰ and bowmen to defend them on
all sides. So they dug to the foundations of the wall and fixed
timbers and wood under it and then set fire to it. However, evening
had come; the tower had already fallen in the night, and because
it was night they could not fight with the enemy. Indeed, during
that night the Turks hastily built up and restored the wall so strong-
ly that when day came no one could harm them on that side.

Now the Count of Normandy came up, Count Stephen and many
others, and finally Roger of Barneville. At length Bohemund‚ at
the very front, besieged the city. Beside him was Tancred‚ after
him Duke Godfrey, then the Count of St. Gilles, next to whom was
the Bishop of Puy. It was so besieged by land that no one dared
to go out or in. There all our forces were assembled in one body,
and who could have counted so great an army of Christ? No one,
as Ι think, has ever before seen so many distinguished knights,
or ever will again!

However, there was a large lake on one side of the city, on which
the Turks used to send out their ships, and go back and forth and
bring fodder, wood, and many other things. Then our leaders
counselled together and sent messengers to Constantinople to tell
the Emperor to have ships brought to Civitote, where there is a
tort, and that he should order oxen to be brought to drag the ships
over the mountains and through the woods, until they neared the
lake. This was done forthwith‚ and he sent his Turcopoles with
them. They did not want to put the ships on the lake on the very
day that they were brought across, but under cover of night they
launched thern on the lake itself. (The boats were) filled with
Turcopoles well decorated with arms. Moreover, at earliest day-
break the ships stood in good order and hastened through the lake
against the city. The Turks marvelled upon seeing them, not know-
ing whether they were manned by their own forces or the Emper-
or’s. However, after they recognized that it was the host of the
