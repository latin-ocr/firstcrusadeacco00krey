THE FIRST CRUSADE 11

memory, her chronology is uncertain, her statement of fact often
inaccurate, and her style highly rhetorical and affected. Never very
certain of the identity of the Latin leaders, as she herself con-
fesses, she calls them all counts and confuses one group with another
in hopeless fashion. Nevertheless, her work is exceedingly valuable
as a presentation of the Byzantine attitude toward the Latins, and
her conception of her father’s feeling toward the XVesterners 6311
probably be relied upon as correct. A MS copy of the account,
corrected by Anna herself, is preserved at Florence. Other frag-
ments also remain.

It 15 necessary to include in the list of eye-witness accounts of
the First Crusade the work by Peter Tudebode, a priest of Civray.5
This work, once regarded as the original of the Gesta, has been
dethroned from that position by recent criticism. It is almost a
verbatim copy of the latter, with portioris added from the account
of Raymond of Agilles, together with a very few personal remarks
and observations. He speaks of the death of his brother in Antioch
and his own share in the funeral services. His account differs
from that of the Gesta primarily in the change of adjectives qualify-
ing Raymond of Toulouse and Bohemund, for Tudebode was a
follower of Count Raymond. However, this policy is not con-
sistently maintained. At best, the work may be regarded as an eye-
witness corroboration of the Gesta. It was written after both the
account by the Anonymous and by Raymond had been composed‚
and sometime before 1111, after which date it was quoted by other
writers. Four MS copies are preserved.

Ekkehard ofsA-ura, who is still regarded as one of the greatest v ³ ’

of the German historians of the Middle Ages, was a monk at Cor·
vey when the First Crusade was preached. He accompanied a
later band of crusaders in 1101 as far as Constantinople by land,
and by sea from there to Joppa. At Jerusalem he saw a copy of
the Gesta, which he made a basis for his own history. This work
he wrote for the Abbot of Corvey in 1112, after he himself had
become Abbot of Aura. The language and the style of this book
reveal a greater familiarity with classical authors than is shown by
any of the preceding accounts of the Crusade. Its value rests chiefly
upon his eye-witness account of the Crusade of 1101, and his brief
items about the Peasants’ Crusade, of which no direct chronicle
has come down to us. Only the latter material has been included in
the following translation. Six MS copies of the work are extant.
