THE FIRST CRUSADE 141

Turcopoles who either were reared among the Turks, or were born
of a Turkish father and a Christian mother. These peoples, more-
over, because they had hurt us on the march confessed that they
were afraid to meet us. All this, however, that mangled Totius
had made up, and he had made such comments in order to be able
to get away. This man, after heaping up not only (these) state-
ments, but even the very greatest insults, betrayal of his com-
panions, and perjury, slipped away in ssight, after having granted to
Bohemund two or three cities, Τιινεο,21 Mamistra, Adana. Accord—
ingly, after acquiring everlasting shame for himself and his people
in this way, he feigned a journey to the army of the Emperor, and,
leaving his tents and his servants, he set out with the curse of God.2²

It was announced to us at this time that the chief of the Caliph
was coming to the help of Antioch with a large army, which he was

more than two housand in each squadron. What, indeed, shall I
say of their boldness, when the knights even sang the military songs
so festively that they regarded the coming battle as if it were a
game? Moreover, the battle happened to be fought in this place
where the swamp and river are a mile apart. This, however, pre—

us in their usual manner. For God, who had given us other things,
afforded us six successive valleys for advancing to battle. In one
hour after going forth the field was taken, and while the sun shone
