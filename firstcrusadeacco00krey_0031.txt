THE FIRST CRUSADE 15

Stephen were common enough, and little variation occurs. But
Adhemar, papal leader of the expedition, seems to have had a
baffiing name, probably due to its similarity to a variety of names.
As a result, his name appears as Haymarus, Aimarus, Ademarus,
or Adhemarus, or not at all. Guibert, in describing the Pope’s
appointment of a vicar for the Crusade, confesses that he does not
know his name, an interesting comment on the isolation of the time.
His use of the name later may be an indication that he was using
his original too closely, for the author of the Gesta, too, was igno-
rant of the name until later in the expedition. For the purposes of
this translation, however, the names of the XVestern leaders are
standardized. This is not the case with Oriental names, the un-
usual character of which occasioned the chroniclers a great deal
of trouble. The name of the Turkish ruler of Antioch may be
cited as a typical instance. The common spelling of his name today
is Yagi-Sian or lagi-Sian. It appears in the accounts, however,
wth the Latin ending as onian-us, Cassian-us, Caspian-us, and
even Gracianus. Fulcher‚ who coined the first of these, succeeded
remarkably well on the whole. In the case of less prominent men
who are mentioned only once or twice, the variations have caused
considerable confusion, leading even to the belief that they were
different persons—eg, Godfrey of Lastours, who appears as Gul-
ferrus de Daturre, Golprius de turribus, and Gosfridus de Dasturs.
This example seems to indicate the beginning of the use of surnames,
but it is probably fortunate for the reader that the movement had
not yet developed far. The efforts of the Crusaders to distinguish
between the numerous Raymonds, Roberts, Stephens, Baldwins,
and Godfreys, are of interest as early factors in the movement which
led to the growth of heraldry and the multiplicatiori of names.

2. Expressions of time.

The reader will doubtless be impressed by the absence in the
chronicles of precise and minute statements of time, which are such
a marked feature of modern industrial life. The year seems to
have been of little account as a basis for reckoning time, for the
author of the Gesta mentions it only once during the whole nar-
rative which extends over a period ot' four years, and Raymond ot'
Agilles scarcely more often. The more learned Fulcher uses it, to
be sure, but rather as an ornament than because he feels the need
of such a measure of time. The great festival days of the Church
constituted the chief standards of time, and here, thanks to the in-
fluence of the Church, we find a fairly uniform practice among the
writers. The necessity of determining the variable date of Easter
