100 THE FIRST CRUSADE

courts! It would be too tedious to enumerate what wealth there
is there of every kind, of gold, of silves, of every kind of robes,
and of holy relies. There traders at all times bring by boat all the
necessities ot’ man. They have, I judge, about twenty thousand
eunuchs constantly living there.

Then‚ after we were sufficiently rested, our leaders, having taken
counsel, made under oath a treaty with the Emperor at his own
‘instigation This treaty Bohemund and Duke Godfrey‚ who had
preceded us‚)1ad already made. But Count Raymond then refused
to subscribe to it. The Count of Flanders, though, took the oath
like the rest. For it was essential that all establish friendship with
the Emperor, since without his counsel and aid we would not be
able to make the journey easily, nor would those who were to fol-
