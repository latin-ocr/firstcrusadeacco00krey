THE FIRST CRUSADE 183

and killed as many of them as they could catch. We, however,

returned to the city with great joy and praised and blessed God,
who gave the victory to His people.

Thereupon, when the Emir who was guarding the citadel saw that
Curbara and all the rest had fied from the field before the army of
the Franks, he was greatly frightened. Immediately and with great
haste he sought the standards of the Franks. Accordingly, the
Count of St. Ciues, who was stationed before the citadel, ordered
his standard to be brought to him. The Emir took it and carefully
placed it on the tower. The Longobards who were there said im-
mediately: “This is not Bohemund’s standard!'' Then the Emir
asked and said: “VVhose is it ?’' They answered: “It belongs to
the Count of St. Gilles.” Thereupon, the Emir went and seized
the standard and returned it to the Count. But at that hour the
venerable man, Bohemund, came and gave him his standard. He
received it with great joy and entered into an agreement with Bohe-
mund that the pagans who wished to take up Christianity might
remain with him (Bohemund), and that he should permit those who
wished to go away to depart safe and without any hurt. He agreed
to all that the Emir demanded and straightway sent his servants
into the citadel. Not many days after this the Emir was baptized
with those of his men who preferred to recognize Christ. But
those who wished to adhere to their own laws Lord Bohemund had
conducted to the land of the Saracens.

This battle was fought on the fourth day before the Kalends of,
July, on the vigil of the apostles Peter and Paul, in the reign of
our Lord Jesus Christ, who has honor and glory forever and ever.

Amen. And after our enemies had now been completely conquered, ,

we gave fitting thanks to God, Three and One, and the Highest.
Some of the enemy, exhausted, others, wounded in their flight hither
and thither, succumbed to death in valley, forest, fields‚ and roads.
But the people of Christ, that is, the victorious pilgrims, returned
to the city, rejoicing in the happy triumph over their defeated foes.

(Raymond). As we have said, when our men were beaten,
discoumged, and in narrow straits, divine aid appeared. And the
blessed Andrew taught us through the youth who had spoken of
the Lance how we ought to conduct ourselves before the battle
and in the battle :—

“You have all offended deeply, and you have been deeply humbled;
and you have cried out to the Lord, and the Lord has heard you.
And now let each one turn himself to the Lord because of his sins,
and let him give five alms because of the five wounds of the Lord.
