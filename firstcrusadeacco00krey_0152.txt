Ag ain 111(1 ξκ ain Ι uige 3ou, 16ξι(1615 of this letter, to pray for us,
and 3ou, Lord Amhbishop, not to delay recommending the same
ιξι5 l< to 3our bishops. And know for a fact that we have acquired
two hundred cities and fortresses for the Lord. Let the Mother
Church of the VVest be joyful; she who has borne such offspring
ιο acquire so glorious a name for her and to aid so marvelously the
Church of the East. And that you may believe this (to be genuine),
know that you have sent me a tapestry through Raymond of Cas-

Great, ιο ι116 lords and vassals of the whole world who cherish the

which your hearts should be filled with the greatest joy.

At the end of the month of May, indeed, we made a stand to do
battle with the Turks. Thanks to God, however, we overcame them.
Of them, moreover, thirty thousand are undoubtedly dead; of us
but three thousand rest in peace, who are without any doubt glory-

measure an abundance of gold, silver‚ and precious garments, as
