30 THE FIRST CRUSADE

the Lord Himself if you have not helped those who are counted,
like yourselves‚ of the Christian faith! Let those who have been
accustomed to make private war against the faithful carry on to a
successful issue a war against infidels, which ought to have been
begun ere now. Let these who for a long time have been robbers
now become soldiers of Christ. Let those who once fought against
brothers and relatives now fight against barbarians, as they ought.
Let those who have been hirelings at low wages now labor for an
eternal reward. Let those who have been wearing themselves out
to the detriment of body and soul now labor for a double glory.
On the one hand will be the sad and poor, on the other the joyous

no obstacle stand in the way of those who are going, but, after
their affairs are settled and expense money is collected, when the
winter has ended and spring has come, let thern zealously under-
take the journey under the guidance of the Lord.''

horrible tale has gone forth and very frequently has been brought
to our ears; namely‚ that a race from the kingdom of the Persians,
an accursed race, a race utterly alienated from God, a generation,
forsooth, which has neither directed its heart nor entrusted its
spirit to God, has invaded the lands of those Christians and has
depopulated thern by the sword‚ pillage‚ and fire; it has led away a
part of the captives into its own country, and a part it has destroyed
by cruel tortures; it has either entirely destroyed the churches of
God or appropriated them for the rites of its own religion. They
destroy the altars, after having defiled them with their uncleanness.
They circumcise the Christians‚ and the blood of the circumcision
they either spread upon the altars or pour into the vases ot' the
baptismal font. WVhen they wish to torture people by a base death,
they perforate their navels, and, dragging forth the end of the in-
testines, bind it to a stake; then with flogging they lead the victim
around until his viscera have gushed forth, and he falls prostrate
upon the ground. *Others they bind to a post and pierce with ar-
rows. Others they compel to extend their necks, and then, attack-
