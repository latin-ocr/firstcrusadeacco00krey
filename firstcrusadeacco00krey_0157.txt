THE FIRST CRUSADE 135

flight. The enemy, indeed, without delay, without pity, slaughtered
and pursued the living and despoiled the bodies of the dead. More-
over, it was not enough for our men to leave their arms, take flight,
despise shame, but they rushed into the river to be overwhelmed
with stones or arrows of the enemy, or to remain under water. If
skill and strength in swimming bore anyone across the river, he
reached the camp 01 his companions. However, our ssight extended
from their bridge to our bridge. They there killed about fifteen
of our knights and about twenty foot-soldiers. The standard-bearet·
of the Bishop was killed there, and his standard was captured. A
certain very noble youth, Bernard Raymond of Beziers, died there.
Let the servants of God neither complain nor be angry with us, if
our men bequeathed such open 51131116 10 1116 memory of our army; ’
511166 God‚ who in this way desired to drive to penance the minds
of adulterers and robbers, at the same time gladdened our army in
Hispania. For a rumor, going forth from our camp, announced to
Bohemund and his fellows that all was prosperous, and that the
Count had gained a most noble victory. Moreover, this report
aroused their spirits no little. After Bohemund had besieged a
certain village, he heard some of his peasants suddenly fieeing ancl
shouting, and when he had sent knights to meet them, they saw an
army of Turks and Arabs close at hand. Moreover, among those
who had set out to determine the cause of the ssight and outcry
was the Count of Flanders‚ and with him certain Provencals. For
all from Burgundy, Auvergne, Gascony, and all Goths19 are called
ProvencaIS, while the others are called of the Frankish race: that
is, in the army; among the enemy, however, all are spoken of as
Frankish. This Count of Flanders‚ 35 we have said, however,
thinking it a disgrace to report about the enemy before attacking
them, rushed impetuously against the phalanxes of the Turks. The
Turks, indeed, unaccustomed to conduct battles with swords‚ took
to flight for refuge. Nor did the Count sheathe his sword until
he had removed a hundred of the enemy from 1116. When he
was now returning to Bohemund as victor, he saw twelve thousand
Turks coming behind him, and rising up on the nearest hill toward
the left he saw a countless multitude 01 foot-soldiers. Then, after
communicating his plan to the rest 01 1116 army, he took a number
01 men back with him and violently attacked the Turks. Bohemund,
indeed, followed at a distance with the rest and guarded the rear
lines. For the Turks have this custom in fighting: even though they
are fewer in number, they always strive to encircle their enemy.
This they attempted to do in this battle also, but by the foresight
01 Bohemund the wiles of the enemy were prevented. When, how-
