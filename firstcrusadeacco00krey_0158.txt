136 THE FIRST CRUSADE

ever, the ‘l'urks and the Arabs, coming against the (jount of Flan-
‹lers, saw that the affair was not to be conducted at a distance with
arrows, but at close quarters with swords, they turned in flight.
The Count followed them for two miles, and in this space he saw
the bodies 01 1116 killed lying like bundles 01 grain reaped in the
field. The ambushes which Bohemund had encountered were scat-
tered and put to flight in the same way. ssut the countless horde
01 1001-501611615, 01 which we spoke above, slipped away in ssight
through places impassable to horses. Ι would dare, I say, were it
not arrogant to judge, to place this battle abead 01 1116 fights 01
1116 Maccabees, since 11 Maccabaeus with three thousand felled
forty-eight thousand 01 1116 enemy, more than sixty thousand 01 1116

scarcely enough to keep one man in bread for a day, nor were other
things to be obtained less dearly.

our men were returning utterly empty-handed, they counselled to-
gether and went away through the mountains and places 01 which
they had previous knowledge, making subtle inquiry and buying
grain and other bodily sustenance. This they brought to the camp,
in which hunger was great beyond measure, and they sold a single
ass-load 101· eight perpre, which is worth one hundred and twenty
solidi of denarii. There, indeed, many 01 our men died because they
did not have the means wherewith to buy at such a dear price.
