190 THE FIRST CRUSADE

they attacked the fortress which we had erected against the An-
tiochenes, but accomplished nothing. Howex 3r, they did inflict a
wound upon Roger, chatelain of Lille, from which he died. Seeing
that they were accomplishing nothing on that side, they ascended the
hills. However, when we went out against them, we were beaten
and put to ssight. Then they entered inside the wall, and that
day and the following night we were only a stone’s throw from
each other. On the following day at daybreak they called upon
Baphometh¹³ at the top of their voices, but we, calling upon our
God in our heartS, made a charge upon them and drove them all
outside the walls of the city. There Roger of Betlzenivz'lle died.
But they moved their camp and set siege to all the gates of the city,
seeking to compel our surrender through lack of food.

Thereupon, when His servants had been placed in such tribula-

they would hear no word from him until, abandoning Antioch‚ they
denied Christ and projessed the law of the Persians.¹⁵ When this
message was heard,³,'the Christians„ cleansed by confession, and
stoutly armed by parffiking of the body and blood of Christ, went
out from the gate ready for battle? The first to go forth was
Hugh the Great‚ with his Franks; next the Count of the Normans
and the Count of Flanders; after them, the venerable Bishop of
Puy and the battle line of the Count of St. Glue5³ after him,
Tancred; and last of all, unconquered Bohemund. When, accord-

the Cross before them, they began battle with the greatest con-

who were confused and utterly beaten, and killed countless numbers
