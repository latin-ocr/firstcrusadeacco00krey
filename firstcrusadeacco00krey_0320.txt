the stricter ideals of the Reform Church Party. As a result, he found
little to hinder his rapid advancement. Before the Crusade he had gained
fame as 3 teacher‚ especially in Normandy, where he counted among his
pupils Matilda, the daughter of William the Conqueror, and Raoul, famous
later as a priest and panegyrist. When the Crusade was preached, Arnulf
joined the expedition in the band of Robert of Normandy. His position
was that of chaplain to Odo, Archbishop of Bayeux, the fiery brother of
the conqueror. Upon Odo‘s death early in the march, Arnulf virtually suc-
ceeded the Archbishop, becoming chaplain to Robert οἱ Normandy. In this
capacity he was soon recognized as one of the ablest churchmen in the whole
army. He possessed many qualities aside from his great learning which won
him popularity and influence not only among the leaders, but also among
the soldiers.

²⁰ It is difficult to determine exactly who are included in these terms.
Raoul possibly includes among the Bretons all the Scotch, Irish, or Breton
Crusaders; among the Swabians and Alemanni all the Germans. Likewise,
by Huns he probably means all the Hungarians‚ and by Ruthenians all the
Slavs. The first two terms were often so used by other chroniclers, while
the last two are somewhat inaccurate.

2² The silence of the Anonymous and the other writers who were doubtless
present at the Ordeal is baffling. Possibly they were unwilling to commit
themselves on this disputed question of the Lance, whose validity they had
practically all accepted at Antioch. Fulcher, who was not present, records
the Ordeal and apparently recognizes the outcome as a definite refutation
of the Lance. See Fulcher (Hagenmeyer’s ed.) I: 18: 5.

2³ The final fate of this Lance is somewhat obscure. Count Raymond kept
it and took it along with him to Constantinople. Raoul and Matthew of
Edessa, the Armenian writer, say that he presented it to Alexius. Albert
says that he lost it in Asia Minor in 1101. In the West the dispute about
its validity raged for some time longer. Guibert criticised Fulcher very
severely for doubting it.

NOTES TO CHAPTER VII AND EPILOGUE

²St. George, according to tradition, was born at Lydda, but had suffered
martyrdom at Nicomedia. See Chapter IV, note 24. His remains were
brought back to the place of his birth and a church erected there in his
honor. The legend which the Anonymous here repeats was copied by later
writers and widely circulated in the West by later pilgrims.

²This was the first Latin bishopric established in the patriarchate 01
Jerusalem. The Bishop was spoken of afterwards as the Bishop of Ram-
lah, or Lydda, or St. George. Ramlah and Lydda were but a few miles
apart, the church of St. George lying between the two places. All three
were in the Bishop’s diocese, and one or the other served as his seat, at
various times-hence the confusion of names.
