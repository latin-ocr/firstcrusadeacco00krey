276 THE FIRST CRUSADE

more than 3oo,ooo soldiers. And though this multitude was so
great that it could have occupied all Romania, drunk up all the
rivers, and consumed all the vegetation in one day, yet the Lord
conducted them in such plenty that a ram was bought t'or one
denarius, an ox for less than twelve. Furthermore, even though
the princes and kings ot' the Saracens rose up against uS, neverthe-
less, God willing, they were easily conquered and crushed. And 5ο,
because some were puffed up at the happy outcome of these events,
God opposed to us Antioch, a city impregnable to human might, and
detained us there for nine months, and so humbled us in the siege
outside the city until every swelling of our arrogance relapsed into
humility.

Accordingly, when we had been brought so low that scarcely one
hundred sound horses were found in the whole army, God opened
up to us the supply of His blessing and compassion, led us into the
city, and made subject to our sway the Turks and all their posses—
sions. Since we took this as if it were acquired by our own strength,
and did not worthily glorify God, who had conferred it, we were
besieged by such a multitude of Saracens that no one dared to go

about were now infused with power to take up arms and fight
courageously. Then, when the enemy had been triumphantly over-
come, the army left Antioch because of famine, disgust, and espe-
cially because of the quarrels among the princes.

Setting out into Syria, we took by storm the Saracen cities, Barra
and Marra, and acquired all the fortresses of the region. While
we were delaying here and there, there was so great a famine in
the army that the already fetid bodies of Saracens were eaten by
Christian people. At length, when upon Divine admonition we
were advancing into the interior of Hispania, we had with us the
most generous‚ compassionate, and most victorious hand of the
Omnipotent Father. For the citizens and chatelains of the region
through which we were advancing sent ambassadors with many
gifts, who were ready to serve us and to surrender their walled
places. But because our army was not large, and all were in haste
to go to Jerusalem, we accepted their pledges and made thern
