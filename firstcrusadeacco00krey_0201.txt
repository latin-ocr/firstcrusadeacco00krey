THE FIRST CRUSAD'E 179

Port of St. Simeon. There I fell seriously ill. However, when the
city was taken, Ι came to you. And now, if it please you, test what
I say.'’

The Bishop, however, thought it nothing except words; but the
Count believed it and handed over the man that had said this to
his chaplain, Raymond, to guard.

Our Lord Jesus Christ appeared on the very night which fol-
