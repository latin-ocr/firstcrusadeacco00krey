142 THE FIRST CRUSADE

scattered to shoot with their bows, yet made a move to retreat.
But our nien suffered very much until the first ranks of the Turks
were pushed into the rear, for as we learned from their deserters,
there were said to be not less than twenty-eight thousand horsemen
in this battle. And when the first line of the Turks was sufficiently
mixed up with the following lines, the Franks called upon the Lord
and charged. Nor was there delay; the Lord, strong and mighty
in battle, was present. He protected His children, and hurled down
the enemy. So the Franks pursued them even to their very strongly
fortified camp, which was about ten miles from the place οἱ battle.
But the custodians of the camp, upon seeing this, set fire to it
and fled. We were, however, so rejoiced and exultant at this, that
we hailed as a second victory the burning of the camp.

And thus on that same day the light in the camp was so great
that there was no place toward the city where fighting was not
going on. For the enemy had arranged that, while we were most
fiercely engaged by the besieged, we should be overwhehned by their
unexpected aid from the rear. But God, who granted victory to
our knights, fought among our ‘foot-soldiers (also). And on that
day we obtained no less a triumph over the besieged than our
knights reported over the helpers. Accordingly, after the victory
and the spoils had been won‚ the several heads of the dead were
brought to the camp. And that we might cause sear among the
enemy by the evidence of the (fate of) their scattered allies, the
heads that had been brought along were suspended on stakes. This
we believed later to have been done by the disposition of God.
For when the standard of the Blessed Mary had been captured, they
put it point downward in the ground, as if to shame us. And thus
it happened that they were restrained from taunting us by the sight
of the uplifted heads of their men.

At this time there were in our camp envoys from the King of
Babylon, who, upon seeing the wonders which God was working
through His servants, glorified Jesus, the s'on of the Virgin Mary,
who through His poor had ground to dust their mightiest tyrants.
These envoys, moreover, promised us favor and good will with their
king3 besides, they told of very many good deeds of their king
toward the Egyptian Christians and our pilgrims. Thereupon, our
envoys were sent back with them to enter upon a treaty and friend-
ship with the King.²³
