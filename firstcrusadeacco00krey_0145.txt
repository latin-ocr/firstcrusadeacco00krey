THE FIRST CRUSADE 125

sufficiently displeasing to the incredulous. There was in our army
a certain Count from Saxony, who came to Count Raymond and
asserted that he was the envoy of St. Gilles; and said that he had
been admonished once and a second time to say to the Count: “Rest
secure, you will not die of this illness3 I have obtained a truce for
you from God; I will always be with you.'' And though the Count
believed this fully, yet he was so affected by this illness that, when
he was put down from his bed on the ground, his pulse scarcely
throbbed. Therefore, the Bishop of the city of Orange read the
offices for him as for one dead, but divine clemency, which pre-
ferred him as a leader of his army, there lifted him from death
and restored him to health.

&Vhen we neared Antioch it was not the advice of many princes
to besiege it, especially since winter was at hand, and the army
was scattered among the castles and diminished by the stormy

has snatched us from so many dangers.” Accordingly, we went to
Antioch and pitched our camp so near that the enemy from their
towers frequently wounded our men and our horses in the tents.

(Gesta.) On the next day, moreover, they came ev'en to Antioch
at mid-day on the fourth day of the week, which is the twelfth day
before the Kalends of November. In marvelous fashion we be-
sieged three gates of the city, since on the other side there was no
place from which to besiege (them), for a very steep mountain
constrained us. However, our enemies, the Turks who were within
the city, were so afraid of us on all sides that none of them dared
to offend any of our men for a space of almost fifteen days. ⁷ Camp-
ing immediately in front of Antioch, we found there every abun-
dance——vines full everywhere, pits full of grain, trees bent down
with fruit, and many other goods useful for the body. The Armen-
ians and Syrians who were within the city came out and, pretending
