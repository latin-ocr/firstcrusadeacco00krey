114 THE FIRST CRUSADE

fashion. Though we could not resist them, nor withstand the press
of so great an enemy, yet we (held out) there together. Our wo-
men, also, were 011 11131 day of greatest support to us. They brought
drinking water to our fighters, and, furthermore‚ ever comforted
those who ¹were fighting and defending them. Accordingly, the
wise man, Bohemund, straightway sent word to the 0111615 (to wit,
the renowned Count of St. Gilles, the famous Duke Godfrey, Hugh
the Great‚ the most honorable Bishop of Puy, and all the other
knights of Christ) to hurry and come to the battle as quickly 35
possible, saying that, if they wished to fight that day, let them come
bravely. They utterly refused (at first), laughing at the messengers
and saying, “Surely this is all false!'’ For we did not believe that
those people were so impudent that they already dared to rise up
and fight again with us. Finally, Duke Godfrey, bold and brave,
and Hugh the Great went ahead with their armies. The Bishop of
Puy also followed them with his army, and the Count of St. Gilles
after them with the great host.

Our men wondered exceedingly whence had arisen so great 3
multitude of Turks, Arabs, Saracens, and others whom I know
not how to enumerate, for almost all the mountains and hills and
valleys and all the level places, within and without, were on all
sides covered with that excommunicate race. Accordingly, secret
speech was held among us, praising and advising and saying, “Be
of one mind in the faith of Christ, and in the victory of the Stand-
ard of the Holy Cross, because this day, if it please God, you will
all have been made rich.'' Straightway our lines of battle -were
formed. On the left side was the wise man, Bohemund, Robert of
Normandy, the renowned Tancred, the most 11011013οῙ6 Robert of
Anse, and the famous Richard of Principati. The Bishop of Puy,
indeed, came over another mountain, surrounding the incredulous
Turks on all sides. On the left side, also, rode the most mighty
knight, Raymond, Count of St. Gilles. On the right wing was the
honorable Duke Godfrey, and the most fierce knight, the Count of
Flanders, Hugh the Great‚ and many others whose names I do not
know. Immediately, however, upon the arrival of our troops the
Turks, Arabs, Saracens, Aqulaozi? and 311 1116 0310310115 nations
quickly turned in flight through the mountain passes and over the
level places. Moreover, the number of the Turks, Persians, Publi-
cami,⁴¹ Saracens, Ayulani and other pagans was three hundred and
sixty thousand, besides the Arabs, whose number no one knows,
unless it be God alone. They fied, indeed, very quickly 10 111611

they took to ssight, and we followed them, killing them one whole
