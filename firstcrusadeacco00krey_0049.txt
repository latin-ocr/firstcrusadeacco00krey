THE FIRST CRUSADE 33

place the cross on his back between his shoulders. Such, indeed,
by two-sold 3611011 will fulfil the precept 01 1116 Lord, as He com-
mands in the Gospel, ‘He that doth not take his cross and follow
31161 1116, 15 not worthy 01 1116.’ ”2¹ . . .

(Balderz'c of Dol.) . . . “We have heard, most beloved brethren,
and you have heard what we cannot recount without deep sorrow—
how, with great hurt and dire sufferings our Christian brothers,
members in Christ, are scourged, oppressed, and injured in Jerusa—
lem, in Antioch, 3110 1116 011161 611165 01 the East. Your own blood-
brothers‚ your companions, your associates (101 you are sons 01 1116
531116 Christ and the same Church) 316 6111161 subjected in their in-
herited homes to other masters, or are driven 110111 1116111, 01 they
come as beggars among us; or, which is 131 worse, they are flogged
and exiled as slaves 101 5316 111 111611 own land. Christian blood,
redeemed by the blood 01 Christ, has been shed, and Christian
flesh, akin to the flesh 01 Christ, has been subjected to unspeakable
degradation and servitude. Everywhere in those cities there is
sorrow, everywhere misery, everywhere groaning (I say it with a
sigh). The churches in which divine mysteries were celebrated in
010611 1111165 316 now, to our sorrow, used 35 stables for the animals
01 111656 0600161 Holy men do not possess those cities; nay, base
and bastard Turks hold sway over our brothers. The blessed Peter .
first presided as Bishop at Antioch; behold, in his own church the
Gentiles have established their superstitions, and the Christian 16-
ligion, which they ought rather to cherish, they have basely shut
out 110111 1116 11311 dedicated to God! The estates given 101 1116 sup-
port 01 1116 saints and the ‘patrimony 01 nobles set aside 101 1116 sus-
tenance 01 1116 0001 316 subject to pagan tyranny, while cruel mas-
ters abuse 101 111611 own purposes the returns from these lands.
The priesthood 01 God has been ground down into the dust. The
sanctuary 01 God (unspeakable shamel) is everywhere 010131160.
Whatever Christians still remain in hiding there are sought out
with unheard 01 101111165.

. “Of holy Jerusalem, brethren‚ we dare not speak, for we are ex-
ceedingly afraid and ashamed to speak 01 11. Τ1115 very city, in
which, as you all know, Christ Himselt‘ suffered 101 115, because our
sins demanded it, has been reduced to the pollution 01 paganisrn and,
I say it to our disgrace, withdrawn 110111 1116 service 01 God. Such
is the heap 01 160103611 110011 us who have so much deserved it!
Who now serves the church 01 1116 Blessed Mary in the valley 01
Josaphat, in which church she herself was buried in body? But
why do we pass over the Temple 01 Solonion, nay 01 1116 Lord, in
Which the barbarous nations placed their idols contrary to law,
