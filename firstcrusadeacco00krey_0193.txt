THE FIRsT CRUSADE Δ 171

fire suddenly fell. Thereupon, the Turks who lived in the castle
fought with us inside the city day and night, and nothing else
separated us from our arms. However, when our men saw that
they could not long endure this, because whoever had bread was not
allowed (time) to eat it, and whoever had water did not get a chance
to drink it, they built a fortress and machines, that they might be
more secure. A part of the Turks, however, remained in the castle,
keeping up battle with us, but the other portion was lodged near
the castle in a valley. When the night came, forsooth, a fire from
heaven appeared, coming from the west; and, drawing near, it fell
within the army of the Turks, whereat both our men and the Turks
marvelled. Moreover‚ when it became morning, the Turks, terrified
by sear of the fise, all fied before the gate of Bohemund and were
there lodged. But that part (of the Turks) in the castle kept up
battle with us by day and night, shooting, wounding, and killing.
The other part, however, beset the city everywhere on all sides, so
that none of us dared go out or in, except at night, and (then)
stealthily. Thus were we besieged and oppressed by these pagaus,
enemies of God and Christianity, whose number was innumerable.⁶

These profane enemies of God held us so inclosed in the city of
Antioch that many died of hunger because a little loaf of bread
sold for a besant. Of wine I won’t speak. They sold and ate horse
and ass-flesh; they also sold a cock for fifteen solidi, an egg for two
solidi, and a nut t'or a denarius. Thus everything was very dear.
They cooked and ate the leaves of the fig tree, grapevine, and
thistle, and of all treeS, so tremendous was their hunger. Others
cooked the dry hides of horses, camels, asses, cattle or buffalos and
ate them. These and many such troubles and straits which I can—
not name, we suffered for the name of Christ, and to free the way
to the Holy Sepulchre. Such tribulation, famine, and fears we en-
dured for twenty— six days.

Then the base Stephen, Count of chartres, whom all our nobles* , ⁴

had chosen to be our leader, and who had feigned very great illness ·
before Antioch was captured, basely withdrew to another fortified
place called Alexandretta. Therefore‚ we who had been shut up
in the city without saving aid daily besought him to come to our
relies. But after he heard that a host of Turks was surrounding
and besieging us, he stealthily climbed upon the mountain nearest
to Antioch and saw the countless tents. Seized with a most violent
sear, he turned and fied hastily with his army. Then coming to his
own fortress, he despoiled it and withdrew at rapid pace. But
after he came upon the Emperor at Philomelium, he called him
apart and said secretly: “Know for a truth that Antioch has been
