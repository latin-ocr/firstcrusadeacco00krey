290 NOTES

²⁶ This letter undoubtedly was written in the year 1098, but the date, in
the month of June, seems almost incredible. In the early days of that month
Alexius was on his way to aid the Crusaders. He was met by Stephen of
Blois at Philomelium. Placing full saith in Stephen's statement that the
Crusaders were probably all destroyed, he had turned back toward Constan-
tinople, laying waste the country as he went, in order to make difficult
pursuit by the Turks. He returned to the imperial city toward the end of
the month, and the news of Kerbogha's overthrow could scarcely have
reached him by that time. Under the circumstances, his assurances to the
Abbot about the condition of the Latin Crusaders would be hypocrisy os
the basest kind, if written at this time. It is possible that'the mention of
June as the date of the letter may have reference to the time of arrival at
Monte Cassino, the letter having been written a month or so earlier. On
the whole, Alexius deserves the benefit of the doubt.

³1t is uncertain just who these people were. The name occurs only in the
accounts of the Anonymous and his followers. P. Paris has conjectured that
they were people from Fez in northern Africa (Chanson d’Antioche; II,
305)-

4Not the Publicans of the Scriptures, but rather the Paulicians, a sect
of the Manichaeans. They were most numerous in Armenia. Persecution
by the Greeks had driven them into alliance with the Saracens. Other ad-
herents of this sect were located in the Balkan peninsula near Philippopolis.
The later Albigenses of southern France may have obtained some of their
tenets from this sect.

5The western writers had great difficulty in reproducing the names of
Turkish and Saracen leaders. The title Emir, or local governor, apparently
seemed to them part of the name. The two leaders here mentioned have
not been fully identified. It has been suggested that Admircaradiyum is a
western corruption of ΑΙ Emir Korfidffi, the narne of a Turkish prince who
died in 1113. Miriathos may, in the same way, be a corruption ot* Emir
Atsiz‚ though it is impossible accurately to identify the persons meant.

ssFulcher might have named others to make the list complete, but appar-
ently his object =was to enumerate the distinctive varieties of speech to be
found in the army. Most of the names are easily recognized today. The
Gauls were probably people from central France, the Allobroges from east
central France, the Apulians from southern Italy, and the Iberians from
northeastern Spain.

⁷There is a difference of opinion among modern scholars as to the loca-
tion of this valley. Hagenmeyer accepts the identification of Botrenthrot
with the valley which runs from the north southeastward to Bozanta and
then over the Gullek Pass. It is still used as a main road to Tarsus. See
Hagenmeyer: Gesta, p. 217, note 42.
