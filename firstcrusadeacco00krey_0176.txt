154 THE FIRST CRUSADE

frequently, saying that aid was coming to the enemy. Moreover,
this report came to us not only from the Armenians and the Greeks,
but was also announced to us by those who were in the city. When
the Turks had obtained Antioch fourteen years before, they had
converted Armenians and Greek youths, as if for want of servants, ”
and had given them wives. W'hen such men as these had a chance
to escape, they came to us with horses and arms. And when this
report became frequent, many of our men and the Armenian mer-
chants began to fiee in terror. Meanwhile, good knights who were
scattered among the fortresses came and brought arms, fitted, and
repaired them. And when the gradually lessening swelling (of
pride) had flowed from our army, and courage, ever ready to under-
go dangers with brothers and for brothers, had come (in its place),
one of the converted who was in the city sent word to our princes
through Bohemund that he would surrender the city to us.
Accordingly, when the plan had been communicated, the princes
sent Bohemund and the Duke of Lorraine and the Count of Flanders
to try it out. And when they had come to the hill of the city at
midnight‚ an intermediary sent back by him who was surrendering
the city said, “Wait until the light passes.'' For three or four men
went along the walls of the city with lamps all night, arousing and
admonishing the watchers. After this, however, our men ap-
proached the wall, raised a ladder, and began to ascend it. A
certain Frank, Fulger by name, brother of Budellus of Chartres,
was the first boldly to ascend the wall; the Count of Flanders, fol-
lowing, sent word to Bohemund and the Duke to ascend ; and since
all hurried, each to go ahead of the other, the ladder was broken.
But those who had climbed up went down into the city and opened
a certain little postern. Thus our men went in, and they did not
take captive any of those whom they found. XVhen the dawn οἱ
day appeared, they shouted out. The whole city was disturbed at
this shout, and the women and small children began to weep. Those
who were in the castle of the Count, aroused at this outcry since
they were nearer (it), began to say to one another, “Their aid has
come!’' Others, however, rephed, “That does. not sound like the
voice of joyful people.'’ And when the day whitened, our standards
appeared on the southern hill of the city. When the disturbed
citizens saw our men on the mountain above them, some fled through
the gate, others hurled themselves headlong. No one resisted; in
truth, the Lord had confounded them. Then after a long time, a
joyful spectacle was made for us, in that those who had so long
defended Antioch against us were now unable to flee from Antioch.
Even if some of thern had dated to take ssight, yet they could not
