nothing, unless you have first done penance; otherwise you and
whatever you do will sink, like the melted candle, into the ground.
And he says that if you do penance‚ all that you begin in the name
of the Lord God will perfect and finish‚ and as you see this little
candle last a long time, so will the Lord make great whatever you

And when the Count denied that he had sinned so gravely, Peter
al'so narrated the sin to him, and the Count thus confessed and did
penance.

And again Peter said to the Count, “St. Andrew complains of
your counsellors, that they knowingly advise many evil things.
