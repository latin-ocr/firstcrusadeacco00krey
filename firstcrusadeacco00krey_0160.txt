138 THE FIRST CRUSADE

going to do? For we are not so great that wc can fight on two
sides. But do you know what we may do? Let us make two lines
of ourselves; let a portion of the foot-soldiers remain together to
guard the paviliom, and by feinting they will be able to resist those
who are in the city. Let the other portion, however, consisting of
knights, go with us to meet our enemy, who are lodged here 11631·
us in the fortress Aregh beyond the Iron Bridge.” Moreover, when
evening came the famous man, Bohemund, advanced with the other
most illustrious knights and went to lie between the river and the
lake. At earliest daybreak he straightway ordered scouts to go
out and see how many squadrons of Turks there were, where (they
were) and definitely what they were doing. They went out and
began to inquire craftily where the lines of the Turks were hidden.
Then they saw innumerable Turks, divided into two battle lines,
coming from the side of the river, with their greatest valor march—
ing in the rear. The scouts returned very quickly, saying, Η1361101111
See, they come! Be prepared, therefore, all of you, for they are
already near us.'’ And the wise man, Bohemund, spoke to the others,
“Seignors, most invincible knights, array yourselves for battle, each
0116 for himself.’' They answered: “Wise and famous man! Great
and magnificent man! Brave and victorious man! Arbiter of bat-
tles‚ and judge of disputes! Make arrangements for us and your-
self.” Thereupon, Bohemund commanded that each one of the
princes should himself form his line in order. They did so, and
six lines were formed. Five of them went out together to attack
them (the enemy). Bohemund, accordingly, marched a short dis-
tance in the rear with his line. .

Thus, when our men were successfully united, one band urged on
the other. The clamor resounded to the sky. All fought at the same
time. Showers of weapons darkened the air. When their troops
of greatest valor, who had been in their rear, carne up, they attacked
our forces sharply‚ so that our men fell back a little. As the most
learned man, Bohemund, saw this, he groaned. Then he commanded
his constable, that is to say Robert, son of Girard‚ saying: “Go
- as quickly as you can, like a brave man, and remember our illus-
trious and courageous forefathers of old. Be keen in the service
of 6011 31111 1116 Holy Sepulchre, and bear in mind that this battle
is not carnal, but spiritual. Be, therefore, the bravest athlete of
Christ. 60 111 peace. The Lord be with you everywhere.'’ And
so that man, fortified on all sides with the sign of the 61055, went
into the lines of the Turks‚ just as a lion, famished for three or four
days, goes forth from his cave raging and thirsting for the blood
of beasts and, rushing unexpectedly among the herds of sheep, tears
