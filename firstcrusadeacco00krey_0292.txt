and instruments and machines to besiege them in Jerusalem, and
they have come before me to battle by two days. Alas! What
would be mine, if I had led their people as my own! Vlloe is me!
What more shall Ι say? I will be forever disgraced in the land

Count of Normandy bought for twenty marks of silver, and gave
it to the Patriarch, to the honor of God and the Holy Sepulchre;
