CHAPTER ΠΙ

ALExms AND THE CRUSADERS

(The conduct of Alexius and the people of his empire toward the Cru-
saders‚ as they passed through the land on their way to Constantinople,
seemed incomprehensible to the Latins at the time and has been more or less
baffling to all later writers. There is some doubt as to whether or not
Alexius had sent a definite appeal for help to the West at this time. Chalan-
don, whose study ot' the reign of Alexius represents probably the most
authoritative modern investigation of the subject, maintains the thesis that
Alexius did not call for help, and that the empire in 1096 was less in need
of aid than at any time since 1071.1 Certainly, the Emperor's conduct ap-
pears more intelligible if the Crusaders can be regarded as his uninvited
guests. Their not infrequent acts of violence may even have led him to
suspect their motives, which suspicion the presence of Bohemund and his
Normans from southern Italy—old foes of the Eastern Empire—only served
to strengthen. Possibly there were other causes, also, to arouse the Emperor*
Kohler has suggested that Urban, in arousing the expedition, cherished the'
hope of gaining the submission of the Greek Church‚ either as a reward for
this help, or by intimidation and force, if necessary.2 But whether or not
there was any just cause for the Emperor’s suspicions, the statements of
his daughter, together with his own unquestionable zeal to hasten each band
away from Constantinople and across the Bosporus before the next band
arrived, indicates very clearly that he did distrust the Latins. And yet, ³⁵}
one reads the Latin accounts, it is difficult to find in them evidence of guile{
toward Alexius or a covert design upon the possession of his empire. The l
constant combination of friendly messages from the Emperor and rough
treatment from his soldiers aroused a good deal of distrust on the part of
the Cmsaders, but at first they seemed to give the Emperor the benefit of
the doubt.

For almost every event narrated in this chapter there is testimony from
at least two independent writers. The fate of the Peasants’ Crusade, though
not described by an eye-witness, is quite fully treated by both Anna and
-Alb—ert, as well as by the Anonymous, and Fulcher's mention of the heap of
bones near Nicomedia serves as a graphic confirmation of their statements.
Anna’s account of Hugh’s experiences is confirmed only by the brief men-
tion οἱ his plight by Fulcher and Albert. The rather brief statement ot' the

, Anonymous about Godfrey’s dealings with Alexius is too condensed to settle

the disparities between the accounts of Anna and Albert‚ and the reader
must draw his own inferences. The identity of the Raoul mentioned by
Anna is somewhat uncertain. He could not have been Robert of Flanders,
who was with the other leaders both at Constantinople and Nicaea. The
