240 THE FIRST CRUSADE

Gentile, or 3 Jew, why was it hidden within the walls of a church?
Why near an altar? If it is ascribed to neither, but to chance, in
what historical account is Pilate found to have coine to Antioch?
Surely we knew that it was the lance of a soldier, and a soldier of
Pilate. But what follows is delightful! Ι 11631· 11131 1116 finder leaped
in, after the diggers had been laboring in vain, and that was granted
to one man in the darkness which had been denied many in the open.
Oh, boorish foolishness! Oh, boorish credulity! Oh, credulity‚
easily won! So be it! His integrity corroborates the man, and
nearness to the crucifixion the place. Is this most recent fraud of
that man not evident enough? If he had walked purely, simply,
in the way of God; if he had trusted in the apostle who appeared
to him, he himself would not (alone) bear witness to this discovery
but would obtain another’s testimony. But why do I devote so much
scorn to that person? Because the Provencals ascribe our victory,
which is from above, like light from the Father, to their piece of
iron. Let that grasping Count and stupid rabble regard it as their
own! We, however, have won and shall win in the name of our

looked more deeply below the surface, the Counts of Normandy and

“Either I will die soon, or Ι will avenge the insults of the son
of Guiscard. If the meeting does not occur openly, let it come
secretly. Let the dagger prevail‚ where the Lance will not! Dolus,
an virtus, quis in hoste requirath Since the custody of the city is
mine, then the citadel on the hill, the chief palace, the market place,
the bridge, and the gates belong to me; also the Lance and most of
the people are subject to me. What remains, except that, with
Bohemund out of the way, I shall gain the principality ?”

While he was turning this and much more over in his mind, he
decided first of all that an uprising should be stirred up among the
people, so that Bohemund would be overwhelmed from head to
foot. In the beginning, oaths would be hurled back and forth in
the market place; the clamor would rise to disturb the people; the
leaders from both sides would bring aid to their men; and every
arrow, every javelin‚ would be aimed at Bohemund. While Ray-
mond was digesting this plot in his heart, like a lion, God willed that
this injustice should not be concealed, and it was disclosed to Arnulf,
and through him to Bohemund. Thus the plot was thwarted and
the soul of a man, whose life had already been of the greatest ad-
