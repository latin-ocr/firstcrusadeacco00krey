THE FIRST CRUSADE

PROLOGUE

(Pulcher.) It is a joy to the living and even profitable to the
dead when the deeds of brave men, and especially of those fighting
for God, are read from writings, or, committed to memory, are re-
cited with prudence in the midst of the faithful. For upon hearing
the pious purposes of those who have gone before them—how, re-
jecting the honor of the world, leaving their parents, wives, and
goods of whatsoever kind, they clung to God and followed Him
according to the counsel of the Gospel—those who live in the world
are themselves animated by His inspiration and aroused to love
Him most ardently. It is even beneficial to those who are dead in

Moved, therefore, by the requests of former comrades, I have re-

Franks in honor of the Saviour, when at the command of God they
made an armed pilgrimage to Jerusalem. In homely style, but,

Franks that Ι have mentioned on an equality with the distinguished
achievements of the people of Israel, or of the Maceabees1, or of
many other peoples whom God has honored by such frequent and
such wonderful miracles, still Ι consider it not far inferior to those
works, since in connection with it miracles worked by God were
often witnessed. These I have taken care to report in writing.

In what way, indeed, do these Franks differ from the Israelites
and the Maccabees? In those lands, by my very side, I have seen
them dismembered, crucffied, flayed, shot with arrows, butchered‚ or
killed by other kinds of martyrdom for the love of Christ: or Ι
have heard of it when Ι was far away. And yet they could be over-
come neither by threats nor blandishments! N ay, even if the slay-
er's sword had come, many of us would not have refused to perish
for the love of Christ. Oh, how many thousands of martyrs died
a happy death on this expedition! Who is so hard of heart that he
