THE FIRST CRUSADE 71

After Peter had promoted the expedition, he, with 80‚ooo foot-
soldiers and 100,ooo knights, was the first of all to cross the Lom-
bard strait. Then passing through the territory of Hungary, he
arrived at the queenly city. For, as anyone may conjecture from
the outcome, the race of the Gauls is not only very passionate and
impetuous in other ways, but, also, when urged on by an impulse,
cannot thereafter be checked. Our Emperor, aware of what Peter
had suffered from the Turks before, urged him to await the ar-
rival of the other counts.

(Gesta.) But the above-mentioned< Peter was the first to reach
Constantinople, on the Kalends of August, and with him was a very
large host of Alemanni. There he found assembled Lombards, and
Longobards, and many others. The Emperor had ordered such a
market as was in the city to be given to these people‚ And he said
to them, “Do not cross the Strait until the chief host of the Chris-

tians has come, for you are not so strong that you can do battle , 5

with the Turks.” The Christians conducted themselves badly, in-
asmuch as they tore down and burned buildings of the city and
carried off the lead with which the churches were constructed and
sold it to the Greeks. The Emperor was enraged thereat an‘d
ordered them to cross the Strait. After they had crossed, they did
not cease doing all manner of evil, burning and plundering houses
and churches. At length they reached Nicomedia, where the Lom-
bards and Longobards and Alemanni separated from the Franks be-
cause the Franks were constantly swelled with arrogance.

The Lombards and Longobards chose a leader over themselves
whose name was Reinald. The Alemanni did likewise. They en-
tered Romania⁴ and proceeded for four days beyond the city of
Nicaea. They found a certain fortress, X eroyord⁵ by name, which
was empty of people‚ and they seized it. In it they found an ample
, supply of grain, wine, and meat, and an abundance of all goods.
The Turks, accordingly, hearing that the Christians were in the
fortress, came to besiege it. Before the gate of the fortress was a
cistern, and at the foot of the fortress was a fountain of running
water, near which Reinald went out to trap the Turks. But the
Turks, who carne on the day of the Dedication of St. Michae1‚⁶
found Reinald and those who were with him and killed many of
them. Those who remained alive fied to the fortress, which the
Turks straightway besieged, thus depriving them of water. Our
people were in such distress from thirst that they bled their horses
and asses and drank the blood; others let their girdles and handker-
chiefs down into the cistern and squeezed out the water from them
into their mouths; some urinated into one another's hollowed hands
