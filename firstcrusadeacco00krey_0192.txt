170 THE FIRST CRUSADE

them frightened by yesterday’s battle which had lasted until even-
ing, secretly slippcd away by night and fied over the wall on foot
to the sea, so that nothing remained either on their hands or feet,
except bone alone. Many others whose names ,Ι (10 not know fled
with them. Accordingly, when they carne to the ships which were
at the Port of St. Simeon, they said to the sailors: “Why do you
stay here, wretched men? All of our men are dead, and we barely
escaped with our lives, for the army of the Turks is besieging the
rest in the city on all sides.” But when those men heard this, they
stood stupefied and, terrified with sear, rushed to the boats and
put out to sea. Then the Turks came up and killed all whom
they found, burned the ships which rested on the bed of the river,
and took off their spoils. We who remained could no longer with-
stand the force of their arms. We made a wall between them and
ourselves‚ which we guarded day and night. Meanwhile, we were

, oppressed by such need that we ate our horses and asses.

Then the Turks who were up in the castle pressed us on all sides
so closely that on a certain day they shut three of our knights in a
tower which was before their castle. For the Gentiles had gone
out and rushed upon the knights so fiercely that they could not
resist their force. Two of the knights went out from the tower
wounded, but the third manfully defended himself from the attack
of the Turks throughout the whole day with such skill that on that
day he stretched out two Turks over the entrance to the tower with
their spears broken. Thus, three were that day shattered in his
hands. But the Turks suffered the sentence of death. The knight’s
name was Hugh de Forcenez of the army of Gosfrid of Mt. Scag-
lioso. However‚ when that venerable man, Bohemund, saw that he
could not again lead the people up into the fortress to battle (for
of those who were shut up in the houses, some feared starvation
and others the kas), he was greatly angered and ordered fire to
be placed immediately throughout the city on that side where
the palace of Cassianus was located. When those who were in the
city saw this, they left their homes and everything that they had,
and fled, some to the castle‚ and others to the gate of the Count of
St. Gilles‚ others to the gate of Duke Godfrey—-each one to his own
people.

Then a very severe storm so suddenly arose that no one could
guide himself aright. Thereupon‚ that wise man, Bohemund, was
exceedingly sad, fearing for the churches of St. Peter and St. Mary
and other churches. This fury lasted from the third hour even to
midnight‚ and almost two thousand churches and* homes were
burned. However‚ at the approach of midnight all the fury of the
