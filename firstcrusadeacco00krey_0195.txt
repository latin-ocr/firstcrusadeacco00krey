THE FIRST CRUSADE 173

16311311 01 1116 111611 01 11115 land into Bulgaria, and seek out and
devastate all places, so that when the Turks come they will be able
to find nothing.'’ Willymilly our men turned back, grieving most
bitterly even to death, and many 01 1116 pilgrims died. Failing in
strength, and unable vigorously to follow the army, they stopped
and died along the way. But all the rest returned to Constantinople.⁶

(Raymond). In the night, however, when our men should have
expected the mercy 01 God, many began to despair and let them-
selves down headlong from the top 01 1116 walls by ropes. Others,
moreover, withdrawing from the battle into the city, announced
to everybody that the general beheading 01 311 113(1 601116; and, to
increase their 16315, while some were urging others to resist bravely,
these same 111611 turned in ssight. . . .

In the meanwhile, there was such famine in the city that a
horse's head without the tongue was sold 101 111110 01 three solidi,
the intestines 01 goats for five, a coel< 101 eight or nine. What shall
I say about bread, five solidi's worth 01 1111111611 was not enough to
satisfy the hunger 01 0116 person? This was not astonishing, nor
when they had abundant gold and silver and clothes could it have
weighed heavily upon those who bought at such a price. However,
these things were (now) so dear because the consciences 01 1116
soldiers, troubled with crimes, were bereft 01 courage. Moreover,
they plucked unripe figs 110111 1116 trees, cooked them, and sold them

’ very dearly. Indeed, the hides 01 cattle and horses and other

things which they had disregarded 101· 3 long time they now slowly
cooked and sold so dearly that any one could eat the worth 01 two
solidi. Most 01 1116 knights lived on the blood 01 111611 own horses;
awaiting the mercy 01 God, they did not yet want to kill them.
Moreover, these and many other evils difficult to enumerate threat-
ened and besieged. Another very serious calamity happened in that
some 01 our men fled to the Turks and told them 01 1116 mis-ery
in the city. The Turks, emboldened by this and other occurrences,
threatened us most violently. Moreover, one day 31 mid-day about
thirty Turks climbed into one 01 0111 101111615, whereat our men
became exceedingly terrified. Nevertheless‚ because 01 1116 danger,
they fought with the help 01 God, killed some, and forced the others

, 10 fiee precipitately. For this reason, accordingly, all promised

obedience to Bohemund 101 fifteen days 31161 1116 battle, so that
he might arrange about the battle and the custody 01 1116 city. For
the Count was very ill, also the Bishop; and C'ount Stephen, whom
the other princes had chosen as ruler before the capture 01 1116 city,
had fled when he heard rumors of the battle.
