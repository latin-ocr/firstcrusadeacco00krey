2. The March of tlte Peasants.

A. Peter the Hermit and &Valter the Penniless. (March-August,
1096.)

(Albert.) There was a priest‚ Peter by name, formerly a her-
mit. He was born in the city of Amiens, which is in the western
part of the kingdom of the Franks, and 116 1135 appointed preacher
in Berri in the aforesaid kingdom. In every admonition and 561-
mon, with all the persuasion of which he was capable, he urged
setting out on the journey as soon as possible. In response to his
constant admonition and call, bishops, abbots, clerics‚ and monks set
out; next, most noble laymen, and princes of the different kingdoms;
then, all the common people, the chaste as well as the sinful, adul-
terers, homicides, thieves‚ perjurers, and robbers; indeed, every
class of the Christian profession, nay, also, women and those in-
fluenced by the spirit of penance—all joyfully entered upon this

Indiction, in the thirteenth year of the reigon of Henry IV, third

‘ august Emperor of the Romans, and in the forty-third year of the

Empire, in the reign of Pope Urban ΙΙ, formerly Odoard, on the-
eighth day of March, Walter, surnamed the Penniless‚ a well-
known soldier, set out, as a result of the preaching of Peter the
Hermit, with 3 great company of Frankish foot—soldiers and only
about eight knights. On the beginning of the journey to Jerusalem
he entered into the kingdom of Hungary. When his intention, and
the reason for his taking this journey became known to Lord Colo-
man,6 most Christian king of Hungary, he was kindly received and
was given peaceful transit across the entire realm‚ with permission 5
to trade. And so without giving offence, and without being At-
tacked, he set out even to Belgrade, a Bulgarian city, passing over
to M alevilla, where the realm of the king of Hungary ends. Thence
he peacefully crossed the Morava river.
