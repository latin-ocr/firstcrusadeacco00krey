164 THE FIRST CRUSADE

The ΔκΙςῑιιΙαιιὶ were three thousand in number and feared neither
lances, arrows, nor any kind of arms, because they and all their
horses were fitted with iron all around, and they refused to carry
any arms except swords into battle. All of these came to the siege
of Antioch to disperse the gathering of Franks.

And when they neared the city, Sensadolus, son of Cassianus,
Emir of Antioch‚ went to meet them, and straightway rushed in
tears to Cin-bara, beseeching him with these words: “Most in-
vincible chief, I, a supplicant, pray thee to help me, now that the
Franks are besieging me on every side in the city of Antioch; now
that they hold the city in their sway and seek to alienate us from the
region of Romania, or even yet from Syria and Chorosan. They
have done everything that they wished; they have killed my father;
now nothing else remains except to kill me, and you, and all the
others of our race. For a long time now I have been waiting for
your help to succor me in this danger.''

To him Curbara replied: “If you want me to enter whole-

But on the third day after we had entered the town, Citrbam’s
advance guard ran in front of the city; his army, however, en-
camped at the Iron Gate. They took the forti-ess by siege and killed
all of the defenders‚ whom we found in iron chains after the greater
battle had been fought.

On the next day, the army of the pagans moved on, and, nearing
the city, they encamped between the two rivers and stayed there
for two days. After they had retaken the fortress, Curbara surn-
moned one of his emirs whom he knew to be truthful, gentle, and
peaceable and said to him: “I want you to undertake to guard this
fortress in fealty to me, because for the longest time I have known
you to be most loyal; therefore, Ι pray you, keep this castle with
the greatest care, for, since I know you to be the most prudent in
action, I can find no one here more truthful and valiant.''

To him the Emir replied: “Never would I refuse to obey you
in such service, but before you persuade me by urging, Ι will consent,
on the condition that if the Franks drive your men from the deadly
