238 THE FIRST CRUSADE

01 1116 people had been revealed to him in 11115 way: “St. Andrew,
the apostle,” he said, “appeared to me, when I was half asleep, and
spoke this command in my ear. ίΛ1156 3110 announce to the people
who are laboring that consolation has come 110111 heaven, which the
Lance that opened the side of the Lord will confer when it is found.

Break the pavement at such a place (and 116 pointed out the place),
and by digging there you will find the iron mentioned. XVhen 1116
horror 01 battle threatens, turn that against the enemy, and you
will conquer through it.’ Terrified, I thought that Ι 1130 been de-
ceived by a dream; and that Ι would not disclose it, but would
161113111 5116111 10161161, unless Ι was warned the second and the third
time. The quiet 01 1116 next night was again enfolding me when
the same apostle again returned, uttering the very statement which
he had made before, but like one scolding and in wrath. ‘XVhere-
1016,’ 116 5310,’ 01051 111011 shun me and remain silent? Thou alone
art delaying the safety 01 many. The people have cried out to the
Lord and have been heard; and still thy negligence leaves them as
11 neglected. Hasten, therefore, as quickly 35 possible to correct
this, that thou mayest continue to live.’ Frightened 31 111656 1110105,
when Ι 1130 emerged from the sleep, I was 31 1116 531116 111116 111016
66113111 3110 111016 troubled; yet, still Ι 1165113160 whether to keep the
secret or 01561056 it. In this worry Ι passed 3 whole day, and half
the night, with prayer and tasting, begging the Lord for the third
visit, if the first two had really been from him. The cock had twice
acclaimed the morning, when, at length, just before the third crow,
sleep bound my tired limbs; then without delay he who had come a
first time, who had come a second time, appeared there again, ever
more terrible, ever more commanding. ‘Rise up, go, lazy brute,
mute dog, delayer 01 safety and victory, menace 10 your 161101115,
501366 01 your enemies. Thou hast trembled with sear where there
was no 1631; where it is thou hast no sear? Threats and curses
still continued, when my spirit, terrified with fear at the threats,
6311160 1116 away 110111 sleep; perspiration and trembling coursed
over my body at the same time, and if fire was burning one side,
the other was stiff with ice. By these steps Ι 631116 10 163611 what
Ι 1130 1631116ος you, however, fathers and brothers, do not stop to
test the truth 01 1116 11131161; it remains 101 1116 to point out the place
101 you to dig.”

When this rumor was brought 10 1116 6315 01 Raymond, he called

story, and advised them to dig; and that his words might have
