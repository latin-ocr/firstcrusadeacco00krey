220 THE FIRST CRUSADE

complained much that the knights had gone away without permis-
sion and had left him in danger of death. All promised that they
would not withdraw from the siege of the castle until, by the grace
of God, the foundation had been overturned. But God, who was
guiding them so that they should not be hindered by evils ot‘ any
kind whatsoever‚ so terrified the keepers of the fortress through
the night that they not even gave their dead burial, so headlong
was their flight. Moreover, when it became morning we went
there and found only spoils and a fortress empty of men.

This time there were with us envoys from the Emir of Camela
and from the King of Tripoli. When these beheld the boldness and
bravery of our men, they begged of the Count permission (to
leave), saying that they would return as quickly as possible. Ac-
cordingly, when those envoys were allowed to leave with our envoys,
they returned in a short time with great gifts and many horses. For
the siege of that fortress had frightened the whole region, because
it could never before be taken by any people. BesideS, the inhabi-
tants οἱ that region sent to the Count with many entreaties and
gifts, praying that when he had caused their cities and fortress to
be taken over, he would send them his standards and his seals. For
it was the custom in the army that if the standard of any Frank
was found on a city or fortress, it was not thereafter besieged by
anyone. Wherefore the King of Tripoli placed the standards of
the Count on his castles.

The name of the Count was at this time so great that it seemed
more than equal to that ot* any former leader. And when our
knights who had been sent as envoys to Tripoli saw the regal wealth,
most rich kingdoms, and that populous city, they persuaded the
Count to besiege Αῑςῂειε, a fortress very strongly fortified and un-
assailable by human might, in order to obtain from the King of
Tripoli at'ter the fourth or fifth day as much gold and silver as he
should desire. And so at their vvish we besieged the fortress where
our brave men endured such trials as they never had before. And
besides, most bitter to tell, we lost so many and such great knights.
There was killed Pontius of Balazun with a stone from a petrary,

which Ι have undertaken to compose.

Now, however, Ι shall strive with the inspiration ot' God, who
did all this, to write what remains with the same charity with which
I began. I beg, therefore, and beseech everyone to believe that
these things which they are to hear are true. And if I have ap-
