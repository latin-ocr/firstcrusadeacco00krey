10 THE FIRST CRUSADE

friends. It first appeared in 1105, and the welcome then accorded
it encouraged him to go on with it. The latter part of his work
takes the form of an annalistic account of the Latin Kingdom of
Jerusalem, sor the early history of which it is undoubtedly the most
important single source of information. He seems to have revised
the earlier portions of his history at least twice, and the final
version ends somewhat abruptly with the mention of a plague of
rats in the year 1127. Fulcher apparently had a more extensive
literary training than either of the two preceding writers. His
fondness for quotation has been charged against him as an affecta-
tion by modern critics, but, as a fault, it mars only the latter portion
of his work, written when he was quite old. On the whole, his book
is free from either partisanship or bias. He seems to have been
interested chiefly in describing the events as they occurred, with
possibly an additional desire to attract soldiers from the XVest to
the support of the needy Latin state in Syria. He displays a strong
interest in nature and describes strange plants, animals, and natural
phenomena in a naive manner. His interest in the intrigues of the
lords, both lay and ecclesiastical‚ is very slight, but the general wel-
fare of the people he viewsbwith all the kindly concern of a simple
French cure. As a whole, the book is exceedingly valuable and
very soon was widely read and copied. It was second only to the
Gesta as a mine for exploitation by later writers on the Crusade.
More than fifteen MS copies of the original are still extant.

Of the writings which contribute eye-witness testimony to but
a portion of the history of the Crusade, the Alexiad, by Anna
Comnena, is one of the most important. The writer was the
daughter of Alexius, and, though she was barely fourteen years of
age when the Crusaders came to Constantinople‚ it may be assumed
that the presence of so many rude strangers in the imperial city
made a most vivid impression on her mind. Both Anna and her
husband, Nicephorus Briennius, had been highly educated‚ and when
the palace intrigue in which they were both concerned proved un-
successful and she was shut up in a convent by her brother’s order,
she undertook to complete the history which her husband had begun.
Forty years after the first Crusaders had passed through Antioch
she began her task. In the meantime there had been various bands
of Crusaders from the VVest. Bohemund had taken Antioch in
defiance of the Emperor and had even made war upon him. The
relations of Alexius with Count Raymond of Toulouse had under-
gone changes, and many other events relating to the Latins and
the Crusades had occurred. Thus, with so' much to confuse her
