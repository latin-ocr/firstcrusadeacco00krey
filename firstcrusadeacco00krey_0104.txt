86 THE FIRST CRUSADE

of the Emperor was always filled with gold and could not be emptied
by any extravagance.

After peace and concord between the Emperor and the Duke had
been made on the conditions we have named, the Duke, still more
certain of the Emperor's saith and friendship‚ returned to lodge in
the buildings on the Strait and sent back with honor the Emperor’s
son, who had remained a hostage up to this time. On the day
following, it was announced through the entire army, by order of
the Duke, that peace and honor should be shown to the Emperor and
to all in his command, and that justice should be preserved in trans-
actions of buying and selling. Similarly, the Emperor proclaimed
in all his realm that no one, under penalty of death, should harm
or defraud any one of the army, but that they should sell all things
with just weight and measure to the pilgrims, and, indeed, should
lessen the price.

After these events, at the beginning ot* Lent, the Emperor sum-
moned the Duke into his presence and begged him, on his pledge
of friendship, to cross the sea and pitch his tents in Cappadocia, on
account of the buildings which his incorrigible people were de-
stroying. The Duke graciously assented to this, and, after cross-
ing the river and pitching camp, he and his people tarried on the
plains of Cappadocia.

After this, everything was gradually sold more dearly to the
pilgrims, but, nevertheless, the gifts of the Emperor to the Duke
were not at all diminished, for he feared him greatly. But tlie
Duke, seeing the difficulty of buying necessaries and unable to en-
dure the clamor of his people, went often by ship to the Emperor
and complained to him about the high price of food stuffs. Then
the Emperor, as though unaware of this, and unwilling to have it
occur, again lightened the burden for all the pilgrims.

(An-na.) At that time, too, came Count Godt'rey, who had
crossed the sea with the other counts and was accompanied by an
army of 10‚ooo knights and 7o‚ooo foot-soldiers. He established
his force about the Propontis, his camp extending from the bridge
which was opposite Cosmidion up to S t. Plzocas. While the Emp-
eror urged him to cross the strait of the Propontis, he went on from
day to day contriving one excuse or another and put off the mat-
ter. The real reason, to state the matter simply, was that he was
awaiting the arrival of Bohemund and the other counts. For,

, though in the beginning Peter had aroused this great expedition

to adore the Holy Sepulchre, the other counts, Bohemund above
all, were cherishing in mind the old grudge against the Emperor and
were awaiting a favorable opportunity to take vengeance on him
