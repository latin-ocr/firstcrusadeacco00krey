150 THE FIRST CRUSADE

a price, sought from the others the privilege of guarding it, the
[omit took over the custody of the fort1·ess against the will of his
nien, both to avoid the charge of sloth and avarice, and to show
the path of energy and valor to the torpid. For during the past
summer he had been tried by a severe and protracted illness and
had been so weak during the whole winter that he was said to be
ready neither to fight nor to pay. Although he had done many*
things, yet because it was believed he could do more, he was pro-
claimed a nobody. Accordingly, having come upon this difficulty,
that is, a question of his valor, he suffered such great hatred from all
that he was almost cut off from his own people. In the meantime,
while the Count was ignoring this, hoping that the enemy, oppressed
on most sides, would fiee thither from the city, he was early one
morning surrounded by the enemy. There shone forth then a great
miracle of divine protection, for sixty of our men sustained the
attack of seven thousand Saracens; all the more wonderful, since
the heavy showers of the past days had moistened the forest earth,
filling the moat of the new fortress. And thus no lack of ways, but
the valor of God alone checked the enemy. I do not think, how-
ever, that I should pass over the distinguished bravery of some of
the knights, who, cut off by the enemy while they were guarding
the bridge, could not return to the fortress for refuge, since it was
a bowshot away. Thereupon, these knights, after making a circle
in the multitude of the enemy, reached the corner of a neighboring
house, and there stoutly and without fear sustained the attacks of
the enemy, the rage of arrows‚ and the cloud of'stones from all
sides. Meanwhile, the sound of battle heard in the camp aroused
our men. Thus the fortress was freed from the enemy, and though
they abandoned the siege when they saw aid coming from afar,
and though their bridge was very near, yet the last of them were
cut off. Thereupon, when the moat and the walls of the fortress
had been restored, the bearers of provisions could go back and
forth from the Port in security. Accordingly, the hatred which the
Gount had borne was so lightened that he was called by all the
father and preserver of the army. From this time, therefore, the
fame of the Count increased, because he had borne the attacks of
the enemy alone.

When, therefore, the bridge and the gate of the bridge were be-
sieged, the Turks began going out by another gate, which faced
the south, beside the river ; and they sent their horses out to a cer-
tain retreat between the mountains and the river, which was a very
fine pasture. Thereupon, when the place had been discovered by our
rnen, they encircled the city by a difficult mountain at the close of
