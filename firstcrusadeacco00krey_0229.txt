THE FIRST CRUSADE 207

and four days, during which time the Bishop of O-range died.
There were some of our men who <lid not find it there to their taste‚
not only because of the long stay, but also because of the pressure
of hunger, since they could find nothing outside to take. But they
burned the bodies of the dead because they found gold besants hid-
den in their stomachs, while others cut the flesh of the bodies to
pieces and cooked them for food.

However, Bohemund could not get the Count of St. Gilles to
agree to this matter that he sought and returned in anger to Antioch.
Accordingly Count Raymond, without long delay, sent (word)

All the princes assembled there except Baldwin, brother of the

Antioch toward the Euphrates, had obtained Edessa, a very wealthy
and famous city ; and he had successfully fought many battles with
the Turks.

But before we go on to the rest, this one incident about the Duke
of Lorraine should not be passed over. When he was coming to
Antioch at this time with twelve knights, he met one hundred and
fifty Turks. Thereupon‚ after taking up his arms and urging on
his knights, he bravely attacked the enemy. However, when the
Turks saw that the Franks preferred death in fighting to ssight with
safety‚ a certain portion of the Turks dismounted so that the other
portion might fight in greater security, since they would know that
their companions, having left their homes, would not withdraw from
