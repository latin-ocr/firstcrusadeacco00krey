THE FIRST CRL'SADE 151

the day and came to that pasture. Others, crossing by a ford, led
from there two thousand horses, not counting the mules which were
recovered; for in time past on the journey from the sea the enemy
had taken many mules from us, which were now captured, recog-
nized by their masters, and given to their former owners.

After this, Tancred fortified a certain monastery across the river,
for which the Count gave him one hundred marks of silver, and the
other princes whatever they could; for this fortress constrained
the enemy much. Therefore we were pleased to wait; the fewer
we were in number. the braver the grace of God made us.

(Gesta). Ι can not enumerate all the things which we did before
the city was captured, because there is no one in these regions,
whether cleric or layman, who can at all write or tell just how
things happened. Neve1·thelesS‚ Ι will say a little. Α

There was a certain Emir of the race of the Turks, whose name .

was Pirus‚20 who took up the greatest friendship with Bohemund,

By an interchange of messengers Bohemund often pressed this man
to receive him within the city in a most friendly fashion, and, after

would make him rich with much honor. Pirus yielded to these
words and promises, saying, “I guard three towers, and Ι freely
promise them to him, and at whatever hour he wishes I will
receive him within them.’' Accordingly, Bohemund was now

poverty and misery, and how utterly ignorant we are from what
side we will fare better. Therefore, if it seems good and honorable
to yon, let one cf us put himself ahead of the rest, and if he can
acquire or contrive (the capture of) the city by any plan or scheme,
by himself, or through the help of others, let us with one voice

(the suggestion) saying, “This city shall be given to no one, but
we will hold it equally; since we have had equal effort, so let us

Bohemund, upon hearing these words, laughed a bit to himself

concerning (the approach of) an army of our enemy, Turks,
Publicaui, Ayulani, Azimites, and very many other gentile nations
that Ι know not how to enumerate or name. Immediately all our
