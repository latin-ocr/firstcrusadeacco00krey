THE FIRST CRUsAbE 147

immediately shut off on all sides the 10311 31111 pass 110111 1116 Turks.
As a result, none 01 1116111, already terrified by 1631 01 111111, now
dared to go out either 101· 10111161, wood, or any other necessities.
Tancred remained there with his 111611 31111 began violently to harass
the city on 311 511165. Τ1131 531116 day a very large party 01 Α111161113115
31111 Syrians, who were bringing 10011 10 1116 Turks in 1116 city, came
down from the mountains in 131161611 security. Tancred, coming
upon them, seized 1116111 with all 11131 they carried—grain, wine, bar-
ley, oil, and other things 01 11115 kind. He conducted himself so
stoutly and successfully there that 116 now held all 1116 103115 31111

(Raymond). At the same time it seemed best to our princes 10
61661 3 1011111611 631110 011 1116 11111 above the 161115 01 Βο116111111111, 50
11131 11 1116 enemy should 601116 against 115 again, they could in no
way attack 0111 161115. W hen 11115 11311 been done, our camp would
be 50 strong that, like a city, we would be protected on all sides by
craft 35 well 35 by nature. For we had 11115 10111655 011 1116 6351;
011 1116 5011111, 1116 walls 01 1116 city and the swamp which 1011111611
1116 walls likewise protected us, and did not give the 060016 01 1116
city a chance to fight us, unless they came out through the gates.
On the west, there was the river; on the north, 3 66113111 0111 wall
which, descending from the mountain, extended up to the river.
The people, likewise, approved (the idea) that another 10111655
should be established on the little mountain which was above their
bridge. Engines, too, were constructed in the camp to attack the
walls 01 1116 city; but this was in vain.

And when now in the fifth month 01 1116 siege our ships landed
at our port with provisions, the Turks 01 1116 city began to besiege
the roads to the sea and to kill the bearers 01 supplies. Our princes
at first only endured this; the Turks, however, unpunished 101·
111611 villainy and hoping 101 plunder, pressed us by day and by
night. At length, it was agreed to establish a camp toward their
bridge. But since many 01 0111 060016 had gone away to the Port,
the Count 31111 Bohemund were chosen to bring them back from
there, together with mattocks and other instruments with which
the wall 01 1116 new castle might be made. And when it was found
out in the city that the Count and Bohemund were away, they began
their customary attacks. Our men, moreover, advancing too rashly
and without order, were basely scattered and put to flight.

And on the fourth day when the Count and Bohemund were
returning 110111 1116 Ρο11 with a very great multitude they were
watched by the Turks. Our men thbught themselves secure by
their numbers alone. But why do Ι grieve over many matters?
