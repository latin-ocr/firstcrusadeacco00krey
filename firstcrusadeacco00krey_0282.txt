258 THE FIRST CRUSADE

The Count’s men had taken many Saracen castles and villages and
forced the Saracens to work, as though they were their serfs. Thus
for the construction of machines at Jerusalem fifty or sixty men
carried on their shoulders a great bearn that could not have been
dragged by four pair of oxen. What more shall I say? All worked
with a singleness of purpose, no one was slotht'ul, and no hands
were idle. All worked without wages, except the artisans, who
were paid from a collection taken from the people. However,
Oount Raymond paid his workmen from his own treasury. Surely
the hand of the Lord was with us and aided those who were
working!

When our efforts were ended and the machines completed, the
princes held a council and announced: “Let all prepare themselves
for a battle on Thursday; in the meantime, let us pray, fast, and
give alms. Hand over your animals and your boys to the artisans
and carpenters, that they may bring in beams, poles, stakes, and
branches to make mantlets. Two knights should make one mantlet
and one scaling ladder. Do not hesitate to work for the Lord, for
your labors will soon be ended.’' This was willingly done by all.
Then it was decided what part of the city each leader should attack
and where his machines should be located.

Meanwhile, the Saracens in the city, noting the great number of
machines that we had constructed‚ strengthened the weaker parts of
the wall, so that it seemed that they could be taken only by the most
desperate efforts. Because the Saracens had made so many and
such strong fortifications to oppose our machines, the Duke, the
Count of Flanders, and the Count of Normandy spent the night
before the day set for the attack moving their machines, mantlets,
and platforms to that side of the city which is between the church
of St. Stephen and the valley of Josaphat. You who read this must
not think that this was a light undertaking, for the machines were
carried in parts almost a mile to the place where they were to be set
up. When morning carne and the Saracens saw that all the machin-
ery and tents had been moved during the night, they were amazed.
Not only the Saracens were astonished, but our people as well, for
they recognized that the hand of the Lord was with us. The change
was made because the new point chosen for attack was more level,
and thus suitable for moving the machines up to the walls, which
cannot be done unless the ground is level; and also because that part
of the city seemed to be weaker, having remained unfortified‚ as it
was some distance from our camp. This part ot' the city is on the
north.

Count Raymond and his rnen worked equally hard on Mount
