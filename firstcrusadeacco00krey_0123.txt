THE FIRST CRUSADE 105

to the number of sixty thousand. The rest, indeed, ssed to a certain
fortified place and escaped the swords of the Turks. The Turks,
made bold and haughty by this, sent the arms and the captives which
they had taken there to the Saracens and the nobles of their own
race, and they wrote to the peoples and cities far off that the Franks
were os no account in battle.

(Fulclzer.) Since the middle of May, Lord Bohemund and Duke
Godfrey and Count Raymond and the Count of Flanders had al-
ready been besieging this city. It was then in possession of Turks
from the East, a valiant race of very expert archers. These, in-
deed, had crossed the Euphrates river from Persia fifty years be-
fore and had subjected to themselves the whole land of Romania, as
far as the city of Nicomedia. Oh, how many severed heads and
bones of the dead we then found beyond Nicomedia, lying upon
the plains near the sea! These people, inexperienced in the use of
the arrow‚ the Turks had annihilated. Moved by pity at this sight,
we shed many tears.22

When, as has been said, those who were already besieging Nicaea
heard that our leaders had arrived„ namely the Count of Normandy
and Stephen of Blois, they gladly came out to meet them and us
and escorted us to the place before the city on the southern side,
where we pitched our tents. Once already the Turks had prepared
to unite, hoping to drive the besiegers from the city, if they could,
or at least to fortify the city more securely with their soldiers. But
they were fiercely repulsed by us, and about two hundred of them
were killed. When, moreover, they saw the Franks, so spirited,
and so strong in brave warfare‚ they retreated in haste into the in-
terior, awaiting an opportune time for attacking. It was in the
first week in June that we came, last of all, to the siege.

Then, one army was formed of the many, which those skilful in
numbers estimated to be 600‚ooo strong.2³ Of these 100,ooo were
armed for battle with leathern corslets and helmets. Besides the
army were those unarmed, namely clerics, monks, women, and chil-
dren. What further then? If all who had departed from their
homes on the pious journey had been present there, without doubt
there would have been sithillion soldiers. But at Rome, in Apulia,
in Hungary, or in Dalmatia, some, unwilling to undergo hardships,
returned to their homes; in many different places thousands were
killed; and some who went with us fell sick and died. Many grave-
yards were to be seen along the roads, on the plains, in the places
where our pilgrims were buried.

Be it known that as long as we besieged the city of Nicaea, ‚food
for sale was brought to us in ships, by order of the Emperor. Then
