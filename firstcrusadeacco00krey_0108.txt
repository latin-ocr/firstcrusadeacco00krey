90 THE FIRST CRUSADE

length, Godfrey after a short time obeyed the Emperor. He came
to him and in solemn manner took the oath which was demanded
of him: that whatever cities, lands, or fortresses he should thence-
forth capture from the barbarians (which cities, lands, or fortresses
had formerly belonged to the Emperor) he would in good faith
hand over to the military leaders or prefects who should be sent by
the Emperor for this very purpose. W'hen this had been confirmed
by oath, Godfrey was enriched with great gifts by the Emperor;
he was received in the imperial palace and magnificently dined at
the royal table. He then crossed the Strait and pitched his camp at
Ρεῖεέαηηιη,14 the Emperor seeing to it that an ample supply of ne-
cessities was provided everywhere.

rest of his forces he spread out even to Sosthenium itself. More-
over, as he, like Godfrey‚ was putting off the day of crossing, await-
ing the arrival of the other forces and counts who were yet to
come, the Emperor, conjecturing rightly about the future, feared
that they would arrive and took care with every act and counsel to
hasten the transportation of these men. For this task he summoned
Opus, a man second to none in valor, prudence, and military knowl-
edge, and ordered him to go with other valiant troops by land to the
camp of Raoul. He commanded him to use every means which
necessity should demand to compel him and all his men to cross the
Strait. When Opus saw that Raoul was by no means ready to obey
the Emperor, nay, was even insolent and haughty‚ offering many
threats against the Emperor, he made ready his arms and drew up
a line of battle, hoping, perchance, to terrify the barbarians with
this sight and thus to induce them to cross to the other shore. But
Raoul and his Gauls drew up their lines quicker than the word and
immediately entered into a great battle with Opus. By chance
Pegasius arrived at that very time with ships in which to take the
forces to Asia. Watching the fight on shore from the sea, and
seeing that the Gauls were charging the Roman army too fiercely,
he disembarked and attacked the Gauls from the rear. Hence,
many were killed, and very many were wounded. Thus it was
brought about that those who survived the battle now sought pas-
sage over to the other side. But the Emperor, with his most far-
sighted cantion, foresaw that when Raoul’s knights should tell God-
frey what had befallen them, they would arouse the latter against
