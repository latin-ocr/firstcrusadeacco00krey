THE FIRST CRUSADE 231

All this pleased us; and having commanded him to fast, we said
that the 1116 would be built on the day 011 which the Lord was
wounded on the Cross with it (the Lance) for our salvation. And
after the fourth day, then was the day of preparation. So when
the appointed day shone, the 1116 11]35 made ready after midday.
Princes and people to the number of sixty thousand men as-
sembled there; priests were there in bare feet a'nd dressed in 111611·
priestly vestments. The 1116 was made of dry olive branches and
had a length of thirty feet3 and there were four feet in the height
of the piles. After the 1116 11311 burned violently‚ Ι, Raymond, said
before the whole multitude, “If Almighty God spoke face to face
with this man, and St. Andrew showed him the Lance when he was
on watch, let him pass through the 1116 nnhnrt. If, however, it is
a falsehood, may he be burned, together with the Lance which he
will carry in his hand!” And all upon bended knees responded,
“Amen !'’

The 1116 was so hot that it filled the 311 101 thirty cubits. Verily,
no one could go near it. Then Peter Bartholomew, dressed only in
an undergarment, knelt down before the Bishop 01 Α11)313 31111
6311611 God as his witness that he had seen Him 1366 10 1366 upon
the Cross, and had 'heard from Him what has been written above,

or St. Andrew, or of the Lord Himself; and that if he had told any
lie, he should never pass through the present fire. (He prayed)
that God would forgive him the other (sins) which he had commit-
ted, both against God and his neighbor, and that the Bishop and
all the other priests and the people who had gathered to witness the
test would pray for him. After this, when the Bishop had placed
the Lance in his hand, he knelt and, after invoking the sign of the
cross upon himself, went forth boldly and without fear into the
1116. Η6 stopped for a brief moment in the midst 01 1116 1116, 31111
thus by the grace 01 God passed through.

There are, moreover, to 11115 day some who saw this miracle there.
that, before he had escaped destruction, a bird flew over head and,
after encircling the fire, plunged into it. Ebrard the priest, he 01
whom we made mention above, and who later remained at Jerusalem
for the sake 01 1116 Lord, saw this· , and William, son 01 Williarn the
Good‚ an excellent knight, of good reputation, 110111 1116 region 01
Α1165, bears witness that he saw this. A certain other honorable
knight 01 1116 people of Beziers, William Maluspucr by name, saw
a man dressed in priestly garb, except that he had a robe folded
back over his head, advance into the fire before Peter went into
