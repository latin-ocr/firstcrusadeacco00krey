198 THE FIRST CRUSADE

the citadel, saying that he had given oath to that Turk who had
surrendered the city that he alone would hold it. On this account,
too, since he had done this with impunity‚ he began to seek the
castles and gates of the city which the Count‚ Bishop, and Duke had
guarded during the time that we were besieged. All gave in to him,
except the Count. For, though ill, he was yet unwilling to give up
the gate of the bridge either for prayer, promises, or threats. Dis-
cord at this time not only disturbed our princes, but it also so de-
stroyed harmony among the people that there were few who did not
quarrel with their companions or servants about matters of theft
or plunder. Nor was there in the city any judge who could, or
would, settle these disputes, but as much injustice as he could bear
befell each man. Moreover‚ the Count and Bishop were very ill
and could not in the least protect their men from wrong. But why .
do we delay over these matters? Forsooth‚ our men, once more
enjoying ease and riches against the command of God‚ put off to the
Kalends of November the journey on which account they had come,
although at this time the cities of the Saracens were so terrified and
beset with fear at the flight of the Turks that if our Franks had
ridden forth then we believe there would not have been a city, even

saw it could not at all comprehend it because of its magnitude. How
useful he had been to the princes and the army of God was inani-
fest after his death when the princes were divided among them-
selves, Bohemund going back to Romania and the Duke of Lorraine
setting out toward Edessa. ἢ

On the second night after the Bishop had been buried in
rthe church of St. Peter at Antioch, the Lord Jesus Himself, together
with St. Andrew and the same Bishop, stood before that Peter
Bartholomew who had spoken of the Lance, in the chapel of the
Count where the Lance of the Lord was. And the Bishop spoke to
him, saying:

“Thanks be to God‚ to Bohemund, and to all of you, my brothers,
who have delivered me from hell. For I had sinned gravely after
the Lance of the Lord was found. On this account I was led down
into hell and there most severely punished, and my head and face
were burned, as you can see. My soul was there from the hour in
which it went forth from my body until my poor body was given to
the dust. The Lord gave to me amidst the burning flames the gar-
