46 THE FIRST CRUSADE

(Ekkelzard.) Moreover‚ the sign which was described before as
seen in the sun, and many portents which appeared in the air, as
well as on the earth, stimulated many, who had been backward be-
fore, to undertakings of this kind. Some of these portents I have
deemed it desirable to insert here, but to tell all would certainly
take too long. For we, too, about the Nones of October, saw a
comet in the southern sky, its radiance extending out obliquely, like
a sword; and two years later, on the sixth day before the Kalends
of March, 1099, we saw another star in the east changing its posi-
tion by leaps at long intervals. There were also blood-red clouds
rising in the east, as well as in the west, and darting up into the
zenith to meet each other; and, again, about midnight, fiery splen—
dors rushed up in the north; and frequently we even saw torches of
fire flying through the air, as we proved by many witnesses. About
three o’clock one day some years before this, Sigger, a certain
priest of exemplary life, saw two knights rushing at each other in
the air, and after they had fought for a long time, the one who bore
a large cross, with which he seemed to strike the other, emerged
as victor. At the same time, the priest‚ G-, who now belongs to
the monastic profession with us, having paid the sheep which is
owed to Christ in place of the first born of the ass, was walking
one day at the noon Lex-r in a wood, with two companions‚ when he
saw a sword of wondrous length (which came, he knew not
whence) carried up on high by a whirlwind. Until the great height
hid it from his eyes, he not only saw the metat but heard the crash-
ing of the weapon. Some men who were keeping watch in a horse
pasture also reported that they saw the semblance of a city in the
air, and that they saw divers companies, both on horseback and on
foot, hastening to it from different directions. Some even showed
the sign of the cross stamped by divine power upon their fore-
heads, or clothes, or upon some part of the body; and by this sign
they believed that they had been predestined for the same army of
the Lord. Again, others, pricked by a sudden change of heart, or
taught by visions of the night, resolved to sell their lands and goods‚
and to sew upon their clothes the sign of the cross. To all these
people, who flocked to the churches in incredible numbers, the
priests, in a new rite, distributed swords along with a blessing and
pilgrims’ staves and bags. Why should I mention the fact that in
those days a certain woman continued pregnant for two years and,
at last, brought forth a boy who could speak from birth? Like-
wise„ a child was born with a double set of limbs, and another with
two heads; some lambs, also, with two heads. Again, foals were
born which possessed at birth the larger teeth which we commonly
