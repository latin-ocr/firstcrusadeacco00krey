172 THE FIRST CRUSADE

captured, hut the citadel has not been taken; all our men are be-
sieged with great pressure and, as 1 think, have now been killed
by the Turks. (jo back, therefore, as quickly as you can, lest they
find you and this people which you are leading with you.''

Then the Emperor, terrified with 1031, secretly called wido,
brother 01 Bohemund, and certain others and said to them: “Seig-
nors, what shall we do? Behold, all our men have been held in close
siege, and perchance at this hour have all been killed‚by the Turks,
or led into captivity, just as that ill-favored Count, who is basely
fieeing, reports. 11 you wish, let us turn back at a quick pace,
lest we, t00, should die a sudden death, even as they, also, are
(103(1.” When wido, a knight most honorable, heard such false-
hoods, he began to weep with all the rest, and to complain with
most violent outcry. With one voice all exclaimed: “O true God,
Three and One, why hast Thou permitted this to come to pass?
Why hast Thou permitted the people who followed Thee to 1311
11110 1110 hands 01 the enemy, and so quickly abandoned them who
wished to free the way 01 Thy journey and Sepulchre? Surely, if
this word which we have heard 110111 111050 most iniquitous men be

lay, dared to call upon the name 01 Christ 101· several days.

And no one could console Wido, who wept and beat himself
with his hands and broke his fingers and said: “Woe is me! My
lord Bohemund, honor and glory 01 the world, whom all the world
was wont to 1031 31111 love! Alas, what sadness is mine! I did

not deserve in grief to see your most honorable 1300, I who desired'

to see nothing else more. Who will let me die 101· you, sweetest
friend and lord? Why was Ι 1101 dead, as I came from the womb
01 my mother? Why did I come to this sad day? Why was I not
drowned in the sea? Why did I not 1311 110111 my horse to meet
sudden death from a broken neck? Would that Ι 11311 gained 3
happy martyrdom with you, so that I might behold you receiving a
most glorious end !” When all had run to him to console him, so as
to bring an end to his grief, he turned away and said to himeslf:
“Perchance you believe this grizzled‚ shameless knight? Truly, I
have not ever heard mention 01 any campaign which he has made.
But basely and dishonorably he turns back, like a most iniquitous
