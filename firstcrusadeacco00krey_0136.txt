116 THE FIRST CRUSADE

selves hence, because if they can only learn of you, scarcely one
of you will any longer remain alive.’' The enemy, upon hearing
such tidings‚ turned their backs again and spread out through all
Romania.

(Raymond.) Accordingly, we set out from the city of Nicaea
into Romania, and on the second day Bohemund with some of the
princes rashly separated from the Count and Bishop and Dukc.
When on the third day of this digression Bohemund was planning
to pitch his tents, he saw a hundred and fifty thousand Turks ad-
vancing to battle. And while he was drawing up his lines tempo-
rarily and was preparing for battle, he lost several of his army.
In the midst of this, he sent word to the Count and Duke to help
him, for they were two miles away. Moreover, as soon as the
messenger of Bohemund carne to the camp, all straightway seized
their horses and arms and hastened to go against the enemy. How-
ever, when Soliman and those who were with him recognized our
army coming to battle against them, they were forced to fiee, de-
spairing of victory. And thus he who had taken captives and very
many tents from the camp of Bohemund through God's might aban-
doned his own. A wondrous miracle was reported, but we did not
see it; that two knights clad in shining armos and of wonderful
appearance advanced before our army and so threatened the enemy
that they granted them no chance to fight in any way. Indeed,
when the Turks wanted to strike them with lances they appeared
invulnerable to them. However, we learned these things which
we have stated from those Turks who spurned the companionship
of their own people and clung to us. What we add for testimony
is as follows: throughout the first and second day we found horses
of the enemy, together with their masters, dead along the road.

(Fulcher.) When, therefore, our leaders had received the Em-
peror’s permission to depart, we left Nicaea on the third day before
the Kalends of July, and, advancing, we came into the interior parts
of Romania. But when we had been on the way two days, it was
reported to us that the Turks had set ambushes for us and ex-
pected to join battle with us in the plains through which they
thought we were going to pass. We did not lose courage‚ however,
at this news. But that evening‚ when our scouts saw many of them
a long way off, they at once notified us of it. Therefore‚ on that ·
night we had our tents protected on all sides by guards. But early
in the morning, which was the Kalends of July, we took up our
arms, and at the signal of the trumpet we divided into wings, with
tribunes and centurians leading the cohorts and centuries. Then
with flags flying‚ we went out against the enemy in good order.
