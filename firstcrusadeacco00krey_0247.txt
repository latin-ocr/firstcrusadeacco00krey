THE FIRST CRUSADE 225

cities and castles. Some of the Saracens, too, were baptized either
out of zeal or from fear of our law, renouncing Mohammed and
all his offspring. For these reasons, therefore, one of our princes
sent envoys to the cities of the Saracens with letters announcing
that he was lord of the whole army. Thus did our princes conduct
themselves at this time! And Tancred‚ especially, stirred up the
affair. Although he had received five thousand solidi and two very
fine horses on the agreement that he would remain in the Count's
service up to Jerusalem, he now wanted to withdraw and be with
the Duke of Lorraine. On this account many quarrels were held.
At length, ill enough, he withdrew from the Count.

Many revelations were made known to us at this time, which

“The Lord answered‚ ‘I know that? And then: ‘Believe that I
am the Lord for whom thou hast come hither and who suffered for
sinners on the Cross at Jerusalem, just as thou wilt now behold)

“And at that very hour Ι saw there a cross made of two black
and round planks‚ neither polished nor fitted, except that in the
middle the beams were notched and supported each other in turn.
