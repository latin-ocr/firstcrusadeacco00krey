286 NOTES

³7 This recurrence of old Neustria and Austrasia, or west and East Frank-
land, after so many centuries is an interesting example of the persistence of
the Frankish and Carolingian traditions on both sides of the Rhine.

³5 The epidemic which started at the church of St. Gertrude of Nivelle
was known as “St. Anthony’s fire” and worked widespread devastation at
the beginning of the twelfth century.

³9 People of the stem-ducliies of Germany. Ekkehard, unlike Fulcher, does
not use the term Alemanni as a designation for all Germans‚ but only for
those from the region of Swabia.

4⁰ Alexander ΙΙ, who occupied the papal throne 1061-1073, and was suc-
ceeded by Gregory VH.

41Clermont in Auvergne.

NOTES TO CHAPTER ΙΙ

1 See Graetz: History of the Jews, vol. IV: chap. 10 ct passim.

2 Psalms 8619.

3 Psalms 18: 23.

4This legend is apparently one of the older legends of Europe. It was
later applied to Frederick ΙΙ and then to Frederick Barbarossa.

⁵Peter the Hermit‚ whom later legend made the author of the Crusade,
was little known before that time. These statements contain almost all
that is known about his earlier career. He was a monk and after the Coun-
cil of Clermont began to preach the Crusade. There is little foundation for
the story of his earlier romantic pilgrimage to Jerusalem. See Hagen-
meyer: Peter der Eremite.

⁶ Coloman‚ or Koloman, who succeeded his father, Ladislas 1, July, 1095.

⁷Hugh, Count of Vermandois, and brother of Philip I of France. Philip
was incapacitated for the Crusade, since he was excommunicate at the time.
Hugh was one of the older men among the leaders. His forces were small.
His prominence was due chiefly to his relationship with the King of France‚
together with a certain assurance of address, which led the other leaders to
entrust him with diplomatie undertakings. Fulcher is at some disadvantage
in describing the course of the other bands. His statements about them
should be compared carefully with those of the other writers. The state-
ments of Anna and Albert offer a more reasonable explanation of Hugh’s
predicament.

8Bohemund (1058(?)-1111)‚ who appears as the crafty Ulysses of the
First Crusade, was the eldest son of Robert Guiscard. He had begun his
military training early, serving in many of his father’s strenuous campaigns
in Italy, Sicily, and Greece. He was with his father in the successful carn-
paign against Durazzo and Corfu, and when his father was called back to
Italy by the Pope's plea for help, Bohemund was left in command of the
Norman forces in Greece. With these he penetrated the peninsula as far
as Larissa, where he was finally repulsed by the Emperor Alexius. Neither
Bohemund nor Alexius ever forgot those four years of warfare. Among
