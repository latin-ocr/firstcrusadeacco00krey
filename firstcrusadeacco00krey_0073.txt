the Penniless, who, together with many of his good soldiers, was
lkilled ’by the Turks between the cities ot' Nicomedia and Nicaea.
Then in the month of October, Robert, Count of Normandy,11 and
son of William, King of England, started out, after having gathered
a large army of Normans‚ Angles12 and Bretons. With him went
Stephen, Count of lBlois,13 his brother-in-law, and Robert‚ Count
of Flanders,14 together with many other nobles. Therefore, since
such a multitude carne from all Western countries, little by little,
and day by day, the army increased to such a very great number
that, when finally convened, it formed an infinite host from many
regions and of many tongues. However, they did not unite into
a single army until We arrived at Nicaea.

(Gesta.) Soon they departed from their homes in Gaul, and then
formed three groups. One party of Franks, namely, Peter, the Her-
mit, Duke Godfrey, Baldwin, his brother,15 and Baldwin, Count of
the Mount,¹⁶ entered the region of Hungary. These most powerful
knights, and many others whom Ι do not know, went by the way
which Charles the Great, wonder· working king of France‚ long
ago had made, even to Constantinople. .

The second party—to wit, Raymond, Count of St. Gi lles, and the
Bishop of Puy-—entered the region of Slavonia. The third division,
however, went by the ancient road to Rome. In this division were
Bohemund, Richard of Principati, Robert, Count of Flanders, Rob-
ert the Norman, Hugh the Great, Everard of Puiset, Achard of
Montmerle, Ysoard of Mousson, and many others. Next, they went
-to the port of Brindisi, or Bari, or Otranto. Then Hugh the Great‚
and William, son of Marchisus, took to the sea at the port of Bari
and, crossing the strait, carne to Durazzo. But the governor of
this place, his heart touched with evil design‚ took these most re-
nowned men captive immediately upon hearing that they had landed
there and ordered thern to be conducted carefully to the Emperor at
Constantinople‚ where they should pledge loyalty to him.
