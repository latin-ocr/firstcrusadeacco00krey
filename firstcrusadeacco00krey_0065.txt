THE FIRsT CRUSADE 49

But sixteen of VValter’s company remained in llIalevilIcz, that they
'‘fnight purchase arms. Of this Walter was ignorant, for he had
crossed long before. Then some of the Hungarians of perverse
minds, seeing the absence of &Valter and his army, laid hands upon
those sixteen and robbed them of arms, garments, gold and silver and
so let them depart, naked and empty-handed. Then these distressed
pilgrims, deprived of arms and other things, hastened on their way
to Belgrade, which has been mentioned before, where Walter with
all his band had pitched tents for camp. They reported to him the
misfortune which had befallen them, but &Valter heard this with
equaniniity, ⁴because it would take too long to return for vengeance.

On the very night when those comrades, naked and empty—handed,
were received, Walter sought to buy the necessaries of life from
a chief of the Bulgarians and the magistrate of the city; but these
men, thinking it a pretense, and regarding them as spies, forbade
the sale of any thing to them. Wherefore, Walter and his com·
panions, greatly angered, began forcibly to seize and lead away the
herds of cattle and sheep, which were wandering here and there
through the fields in search of pasture. As a result, a serious strife
arose between the Bulgarians and the pilgrims who were driving

away the flocks, and they carne to blows. However, while the¹ ·

strength of the Bulgarians was growing even to one hundred and
forty, some of the pilgrim army, cut off from the multitude of
their companions, arrived in ssight at a chapel. But the Bulgarians,
their army growing in number, while the band of Walter was weak-
ening and his entire company scattered, besieged the chapel and
burned sixty who were within; on most of the others, who escaped
from the enemy and the chapel in defense of their lives, the Bul-
garians inflicted grave wounds.

After this calamity and the loss of his people, and after he had
passed eight days as a fugitive in the forests of Bulgaria, Walter,
leaving his men scattered everywhere, withdrew to Nish‚ a very
wealthy city in the midst of the Bulgarian realm. There he found
the duke and prince of the land and reported to him the injury
and damage which had been done him. From the duke he obtained
justice for all; nay, more, in reconciliation the duke bestowed upon
him arms and money, and the same lord of the land gave him
peaceful conduct through the cities of Bulgaria, Sosia, Philippopolis,
and Adrianople, and also license to trade.

He went down with all his band, even to the imperial city, Con-
stantinople, which is the capital of the entire Greek empire. And
when he arrived there, with all possible earnestness and most hurn-
ble petition he implored from the Lord Emperor himself permission
