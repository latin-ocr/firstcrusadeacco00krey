to the Emperor, from whom they were sent. They assured the Emperor that
the fortunes and hopes of the Gauls were reduced to very narrow straits;
nay, they swore that absolute destruction threatened thern. The Emperor,
much inflamed at this announcement, decided all the more quiekly to hasten
the aid which he was bringing them, but all dissuaded him from so rash a
plan.” . . . Anna XI, 6.

⁹St. Mercurius, according to legend, was the head of the army of the

for the man. It seems to have arisen from a careless translation of the
Greek word for spear. On this foundation a legend rapidly arose, and
Longinus became widely known.

²The Jacobites were of the Monophysite sect, followers of Jacobus Zan-
zalus, and were fairly numerous in Syria. The Syrians were probably
Maronites, who regarded the Abbot of St. Maro in the Lebanon Mountains
as their head. The Armenian Christians were also Monophysites. A uni-
versal policy toward heretics had not yet been evolved by the Church at
Rome. From a political and military point of view, it was highly inexpe-
dient for the Crusaders to adopt a drastic policy toward these heretical
Christians in the East. Bohemund’s plea was never fully answered, and, in
