assembly to give their arms in satisfaction to the King‚ according to
this command. Thus everything would return to peace and concord.

And yet, when all their arms had been placed under lock and
key, the Hungarians proved false regarding all the faith and
clemency which they had promised that the King would show to
the people; nay, rather they fell upon them with cruel slaughter‚
cut down the defenceless and unarmed and inflicted upon them
frightful slaughter, to such an extent (as those affirm for a truth
who were present and barely escaped) that the entire plain of Bel-
grade was filled by the bodies of the slain and was covered with
their blood. Few escaped from that martyrdom.

(Ekkelzczrd.) Now, as has been said, a band followed Folcmar
through Bohemia. At the city of Neitra, in Pannonia, an uprising
took place, in which a part were killed. and a part were taken
prisoners, while the very few survivors are wont to testify that the

C. Emico. (May-August, 1096.)

(Ekkelzard.) Just at that time, there appeared a certain soldier,
Emico, Count of the lands around the Rhine, a man long of very
ill repute on account of his tyrannical mode of life. Called by
divine revelation, like another Saul, as he maintained, to the prac-
tice of religion of this kind, he usurped to himself the command
of almost twelve thousand cross bearers. As they were led through
the cities of the Rhine and the Main and also the Danube, they either
utterly destroyed the execrable race of the Jews wherever they
found them (being even in this matter zealously devoted to the
Christian religion) or forced them into the bosom of the Church.
’ When their forces, already increased by a great number of men and
women, reached the boundary of Pannonia, they were prevented by
well fortified garrisons from entering that kingdom, which is sur-
