raging current While Antioch was still resisting the princes 01 Gaul,
by whom it was enclosed, 3 quarrel arose between the adherents 01
Bohemund and Raymond. Men 01 both parties were sent to gather
grain. They found food and 3 fight at one and the same time, and
the grain was divided by the sword. Both parties were wounded,
