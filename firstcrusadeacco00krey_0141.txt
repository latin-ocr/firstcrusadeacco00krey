THE FIRST CRUSADE 121

shouting at the top of their voices, “Run! most invincible Franks,
run! For the Turks. driven out by sear of you, are all departing.'’
Moreover at daybreak, the leaders of the city came and willingly
surrendered it, saying to those who were quarrelling about this
matter among themselves, “Stop, Seignors‚ stop! for we seek and
wish for lord and ruler him who yesterday so bravely fought with
the Turks.” Baldwin, thereupon, wonderful Count, quarrelled and
disputed with Tancred, saying‚ “Let us enter together, and despoil
the city, and let him who is the more able hold it, and him who
can, ⁴take it.” “On the contrary‚'’ most brave Tancred said, “I will
have none of this, for I am unwilling to despoil Christians. The
men of this city have chosen me lord over them, and they desire to

strategy. Among those which he captured was a very rich one
called Turbezel. The Armenians who dwelt there gave it up peace-
fully to him3 and many others became subject to him.

Since his fame had circulated far and wide, the prince of the city
of Edessa sent a delegation to him. Edessa was a most celebrated
city and most fruitful in the products of the earth. This city is in
Syrian Mesopotamia, about twenty miles beyond the above men—
tioned Euphrates, and about a hundred or a few more miles from
Antioch. Baldwin was asked by the Duke to go there, and to agree
that they should be mutual friends as long as they both should live,
that they should be like father and son. And if by chance the Duke
of Edessa himself should die, Baldwin should immediately corne into
possession of all his land, just as if he were his own son. Since he
