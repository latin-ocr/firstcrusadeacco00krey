THE FIRST CRUSADE 31

ing them with naked swords, they attempt to cut through the neck
with a single blow. What shall Ι say of the abominable rape of
the women? To speak of it is worse than to be silent. The king-
dom of the Greeks is now dismembered by them and deprived of
territory so vast in extent that it can not be traversed in a march of
two months. On whom, therefore, is the task of avenging these
wrongs and of recovering this territory incumbent, if not upon you?
You, upon whom above other nations God has conferred remark-
able glory in arms, great courage, bodily energy‚ and the strength
to humble the hairy scalp of those who resist you.

“Let the deeds of your ancestors move you and incite your minds
to manly achievements: likewise, the glory and greatness of King
Charles the Great, and his son Louis, and of your other kings, who
have destroyed the kingdoms of the pagam, and have extended in
these lands the territory of the Holy Church. Let the Holy Sepul-
chre of the Lord‚ our Saviour, which is possessed by unclean na-
tions‚ especially move you, and likewise the holy places, which are
now treated with ignominy and irreverently polluted with filthiness.
Oh, most valiant soldiers and descendants of invincible ancestors‚
be not degenerate, but recall the valor of your forefathers!

“However, if you are hinde1·ed by love of children, parents, and

father, or mother more than me, is not worthy of me.’1⁷ ‘Every
one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or
mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my name’s sake shall re-
ceive an hundred-fold and shall inherit everlasting life.’1⁸ Let none
of your possessions detain you, no solicitude for your family affairs,

since this land which you inhabit, shut in on all sides by the sea ζῑΥ

and surrounded by mountain peaks, is too narrow for your large
population; nor does it abound in wealth; and it furnishes scarcely
food enough for its cultivators. Hence it is that you murder and
devour one another, that you wage war, and that frequently you
perish by mutual wounds. Let therefore hatred depart from among
you, let your quarrels end, let wars cease, and let all dissensions and
controversies slumber. Enter upon the road to the Holy Sepul-
chre ; wrest that land from the wicked race, and subject it to your-
selves. That land which, as the Scripture says, ‘fioweth with milk
· and honey’¹⁹ was given by God into the possession of the children
of Israel.

“Jerusalem is the navel of the world; the land is fruitful above
others, like another paradise of delights. This the Redeemer of
the human race has made illustrious by His advent, has beautified
by His presence, has consecrated by suffering, has redeemed by
