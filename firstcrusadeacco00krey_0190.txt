168 THE FIRST CRUSADE

mortals, like all the rest; but their God loves them greatly above
all the others and gives them valor in fighting beyond the rest. For
(it is) their God, Omnipotent is His name, who made heaven and
earth and established the seas and all things that in them are, whose
dwelling-place 15 111 heaven prepared 101 311 eternity, whose might
is everywhere to be fea1·ed.'’

Her son said: “(Even) 11 such 15 1116 6356, Ι 111111 1101 16113111
110111 fighting with them.'’ Thereupon, when 1115 mother heard that
he would in 110 way yield to her advice. she returned, a very sad
woman, to Aleppo, carrying with her all the gifts that 5116 could
take along.

But on the third day (urbam armed himself and most 01 1116
Turks with him and went toward 1116 city from the side on which

we prepared ourselves for battle against them, but so great was
their valor that we could not withstand 1116111, and under compul-
sion, therefore, we entered the city. The gate was so amazingly

Corbaya, however, lord 01 1116 Turks, expecting the battle 10

from the city and, with ranks arrayed, came up to the bridge of the
city. Our men, however, had strengthened the fortress 01 1116 Count
