206 THE FIRST CRUSADE

upper compartment, William 01 Montpellier and many others,
hurled great stones upon those who were standing on the wall 01
1116 city and thus struck 1116111 over their shields, so that enemy and
shield fell down into the city to death. So were these men ‹loing;
but the rest held glorious banners on their spears, and with lances
and 11011 hooks planned to drag the enemy to them. Thus they
fought until evening. The priests and clerics, dressed in their sacred
vestments, stood behind the 10111655, praying and beseeching God
to defend His people, exalt Christianity, and 6351 down paganism.
On the other side, however, our knights fought with the pagans
daily and raised ladders to the wall, but their valor was so great
that our men could accomplish nothing. Godfrey 01 Lastour
was the first to climb up the ladder to the wall, but the ladder
was immediately broken by the multitude 01 1116 others. Yet
he climbed onto the wall with a few, and those who had ascended
cleared the· wall close about them. The others, too, found
anothervladder and quickly set it up against the wall, and many
knights and foot-soldiers, ascending by it, immediately climbed over
the wall. Thereupon the Saracens so stoutly attacked them from
the wall and from the ground by shooting arrows and hurling spears
everywhere that many 01 0111 111611 111 161101 161 themselves down
from the wall. For a long time those most illustrious men who
remained on the wall bore the attack 01 1116 enemy, as long as the
rest beneath the 10111655 were undermining the wall 01 1116 city.
But when the Saracens saw that our men had undermined the wall,
they were overcome 'with fright and immediately fled into the city.
All this happened on' the Sabbath day, toward the hour 01 vespers,
at sunset on the eleventh day 01 incoming 1ἶ)6661111161·.12

Bohemund, thereupon, had it proclaimed through 311 interpreter
to the leaders 01 the Saracens that they might place themselves,
with their wives and ,children and other possessions, in 3 palace
near the gate‚ and that he would defend them from the sentence of
death. But all ou'r men entered the city, and whatever goods they
found in the houses and in the pits each one appropriated as his
own. However, when day came they killed many 01 1116111, whether
man or woman, wherever they found them. No corner 01 1116 city
was free from corpses of the Saracens, and we could scarcely go
anywhere in the city without stepping on the Saracen dead. At
length, Bohemund seized those whom he had commanded to enter
the palace and took from thern all they had: to wit, gold, silver,
and other ornaments. Some he had killed; others, however, he
ordered 10 116 taken to Antioch 101· sale.

Moreover‚ the delay 01 1116 Franks in that city was for one month
