the way before us, and we arrived at a city by the sea which is
called Beirut‚ and thence we went to another city called Sidon,
thence to another called Tyre, and 110111 Tyre to the city 01 Α616.
But 110111 Α616 we came to 3 fortified place the name 01 which was
Cayphas, and then we came near Caesarea. There was celebrated
Pentecost on the third day 01 outgoing May. Then we came to
Ramlah, which through 1631 01 1116 Franks the Saracens had
1611 empty. Near it was the famous church in which rested the
most precious body 01 St. George,1 since 101 1116 1131116 01 Christ he
there happily received martyrdom from the treacherous pagans.
There our leaders held a council to choose a bishop who should
have charge 01 11115 place and erect 3 611111611. They gave tithes to
him and enriched him with gold and silver, and with 1101565 311(1
other animals‚ that he might live the more devoutly and honorably
with those who were with him.2 He remained there with joy.

quired 01 1116 inhabitants ot' that region how the march to Jerusalem
might be better and more easily made. For there are the mountains
01 Lebanon, 111 which almost sixty thousand Christian men dwell.
The Christians who are near the city 01 Tyre (now commonly called
Sur, whence they are called Surians) have possessed that land and
mountains 101 3 long time. But when the Saracens and Turks
arose through the judgment 01 God, those Surians were in such
great oppression 101 four hundred and more years that many 01
1116111 were forced to abandon their fatherland and the Christian law.
11, however, any 01 1116111 through the grace 01 God refused, they
were compelled to give up their beautiful children to be circumcised,
or converted to Mohammedanism 3 or they were snatched from

images which, 101 lael< 01 111116, they could not destroy‚ and shot
them with arrows ; all the altars, too, they undermined. Moreover,
they made mosques 01 the great churches. But if any of 111056 dis-

at his home, he either redeemed it month by month, or year by year,
or it was thrown down into the dirt and broken before his eyes.
In addition, too harsh to relate, they placed youths in brothels‚ and,
to do yet more vilely, exchanged their sisters 101 wine. And their
mothers dared not weep openly at these or other sorrows. Why do
