THE FIRST CRUSADE 97

he talked about the things which would happen to them on the
journey. He wanted, likewise, to show what methods and means
of warfare the Turks were wont to employ, and to give directions
how the line of battle should be drawn up against them, how
ambushes should be set, and how they ought not to follow the flee-
ing Turks too far. And so, both by gifts of money and by flatter-
ing speeches‚ he soothed the rude nature of the people, and, after
giving useful advice, he persuaded them to pass over the sea. . . .

6. Raymond and tlte Emperor (April 21-May 16, 1097.)

(Raymond.) Although events have lightly accompanied the
writer so far with happy and favorable step, they now follow with
so great a weight of bitterness and sorrow that it grieves me to
have begun what I have vowed to finish. What, indeed, is the most
important and first matter that I shall proceed to mention? The

would devastate his empire, if he made the journey with the pilgrimS.
Meanwhile the Count, upon hearing of the flight and death of his
men, believed that he had been betrayed, and through certain of our
princes he vehemently charged the Emperor with having committed

¹ treason. But Alexius said that he did not know that our men had

devastated his kingdom, and that he and his rnen had· suffered many
