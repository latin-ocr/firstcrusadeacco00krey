254 THE FIRST CRUSADE

been happening at Jerusalem. W'e knew that we had deserved this
missor-tune, for we had refused to place saith in the words sent to
us by the Lord. Despairing of God·s mercy, the men went to the
plain of the river Jordan, collected palms, and were baptized in
its waters. They did so chiefly with the intention of abandonng
the siege, having seen Jerusalem, and of going to Joppa, thence to
return home by whatever means they could. But the Lord looked
after the ships for His unfaithful.

About this time a public assembly was held, for the leaders of the
army were quarreling with each other. There was dissatisfaction
because Tancred had occupied Bethlehem and had placed his
standard over the church of the Nativity, as though it was an
ordinary house. An effort was also made to elect one of the
princes king to have custody of the city, lest what had been achieved
in common should be destroyed in common for want of anyone to
take care of the city, if God should give it to uS. The bishops and
clergy replied (to this suggestion), “You ought not to choose a
king where the Lord suffered and was crowned. For if a David,
degenerate in saith and virtue, should say in his beart, Ἰ sit upon
the throne of David and hold his kingdom‚’ the Lord would probably
destroy him and be angry with place and people. Resides, the pro-
phet proclaims, saying‚ ‘XNhen the Holy of Holies shall come,
unction shall cease, because it will be manifest to all peoples that He
has come.’11 But there should be an advocate to guard the city and
divide the tributes and rents of the region among the guardians of
the city.'' For this and many other reasons the election was stopped
and put off until the eighth day after the capture of Jerusalem.
Not in this matter alone, but in other ways, our affairs did not
prosper, and the troubles of the people increased every day. Never-
theless, the merciful and propitious Lord, both for His name’s sake
and lest our enemies should insult His law and say, “NVhere is their
God ?” sent word to us through the Bishop of Puy, Lord Adhemar,¹²
how we could placate His anger and obtain His mercy. We, how-
ever, preached that this be done without mentioning the command
of God, lest if the people transgressed this command of the Lord,
they should be especially afflicted, as they would then be the more
culpable. For the Lord was so kind to us that He had sent His
messengers to us often, but because they were our brothers we
had not heeded them.

The Bishop (Adhemar) appeared before Peter Desiderius, say·
ing; “Speak to the' princes and all the people, and say to them:
‘You who have come-from distant lands to worship God and the
Lord of hosts, purge yourselves of your uncleanliness, and let
