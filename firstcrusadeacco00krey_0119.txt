poor. Also, in our times, as it seems to us, there has not been a
prince so distinguished for general integrity of character. Your
father, my beloved‚ gave many and large gifts, but he was almost
as nothing in comparison with this man.1²3 I have taken pleasure in
writing these little things εὕρ-μγ him to yon, that you may know a

8. Sieye and capture of Nicaeas. (May 14-June 19, 1097.)

(Gesta.) And thus Duke Godfrey went first to Nicomedia, to-
gether with Tancred and all the rest, and they were there for three
days. The Duke, indeed, seeing that there was no road open by
which ‘he could conduct these hosts to the city of Nicaea, for so
great an army could not pass through the road along which the
others had passed before, sent ahead three thousand men with
axes and swords to cut and clear this road, so that it would lie open
even to the city of Nicaea. They cut this road through a ver-y*

on the walls. We attacked the city so bravely and so fiercely that
we even undermined its wall. The Turks who were in the city,

might approach the city boldly and in security and enter through
the middle gate, because on that side no one would oppose them or
put them to grief. This gate was besieged on that very day—the
Sabbath after the Ascension of the Lord——by the Count of St.
Gilles and the Bishop of Puy. The Count, approaching from an-
other side, was protected by divine might, and with his most power-
ful army gloried in terrestrial strength. And so he found the Turks
coming against us here. Armed on all sides with the sign of the
cross, he rushed upon them violently and overcame them. They
