(March—April 20, 1099.)

(Gesta.) Duke Godfrey‚ Bohemund‚ and the Count of Flanders
went up to the city of Laodicaea. Bohemund separated from them
and returned to Antioch, but they went and besieged a certain city
whose name is Gibellum. Thereupon, when Raymond, Count of
St. Gilles, heard that an innumerable host of pagans was rushing
upon us for battle, he held a council there with his men, in order to
send (word) to the leaders who were at the siege of Gibellum to
come to his aid. XVhen they heard this, they straightway made an
agreement with the Emis, making peace with him, and they received
horses and gold and left the city and came to our aid. But the
enemy did not come to battle against us. Thereupon, the aforesaid
Counts lodged beyond the river and there besieged that fortress.
Not long after this, our men rode against Tripoli and found out-

that even the water which flowed in the city seemed to grow red
and to flow into their cisterns, whereat the rest were exceedingly
sad and sorrowful. Indeed, they were now so terrified with fear
that none of them dared to go out of the city gate. On the next

three thousand camels.

We besieged the aforesaid town for three months, less one day,
and there celebrated Easter on the fourth day before the Ides of
April. While we were engaged in that siege, our ships, forsooth,
came to a certain port near us bearing the greatest market—grain‚
wine, meat, cheese, barley, and oil‚ whereof there was now the
greatest abundance throughout the whole army. At length, several
of our men happily received martyrdom, namely Anselm of Ribe-
mont, William the Picard, and several others whose names I do not
know. The King of Tripoli, also, often sent envoys to the leaders
with word to leave the fortress and make peace with him. Ac-
cordingly, when our leaders, Godfrey, -and Raymond, Count of St.
Gilles, Robert the Norman, and the Count of Flanders, heard this,
and when they saw that new fruit had grown (for we were eating
new beans in the middle of March, and even grain in the middle of
