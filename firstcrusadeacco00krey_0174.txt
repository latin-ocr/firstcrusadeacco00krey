152 THE FIRST CRUSADE

leaders came together, and held a council, saying: “If Bohemund
can acquire the city, either by himself, or with the help of others,
let us give it to him freely and with one accord, on condition that
if the Emperor comes to our aid and wishes to carry out every agree-
ment, as he swore and promised, we will return it to him by right.
But if he does not do this, let Bohemund keep it in his power.”
Immediately, therefore, Bohemund began meekly to beseech his
friend in daily petition‚ holding out most humbly the greatest and
sweetest promises in this manner: “Behold‚ we have now truly a
fit time to accomplish whatever good we wish; therefore, now, my
friend Ritus, help me.” Greatly pleased at the message, he replied
that he would aid him in every way, as he ought to do. Accordingly,
at the approach of night, he cautiously sent his son to Bohemund
as a pledge, that he might be the more secure about his entrance to
the city. He also sent word to him in this wise: “Tomorrow sound
the trumpets for the Frankish host to move on, pretending that
they are going to plunder the land of the Saracens‚ and then turn
back quickly over the mountain on the right. With alert mind,
indeed, I will be awaiting those forces, and I will take them into
the towers which I have in my power and charge.'' Then Bohemund
ordered a certain servant of his, Malacorona by name, to be called,
and bade him, as herald, to admonish most of the Franks faithfully
to prepare themselves to go into the land of the Saracens. This was
so done. Thereupon Bohemund entrusted his plan to Duke God-

the Bishop of Puy, saying‚ “The grace of God favoring, Antioch
will this night be surrendered to us'

All these matters were at length arranged; the knights held the
level places and the foot soldiers the mountain. All the night they
- rode and marched until dawn, and then began to approach the
towers which that person (Pirus) was watchfully guarding. Bohe-
mund straightway dismounted and gave orders to the rest, saying,
“Go with secure mind and happy accord, and climb by ladder into
Antioch which, if it please God, we shall have in our power im-
mediately.’' They went up the ladder, which had already been
placed and firmly bound to the projections of the city wall. About
sixty of our rnen clim‘bed up it and were distributed among the
towers which that man was watching. Pirus, upon seeing that so
few of our men had ascended‚ began to tremble with fear for both
himself and our men, lest they fall into the hands of the Turks.
And he said, “M iero Francos echome—There are few Franks here!
WVhere is most fierce Bohemund, that unconquered knight ?'’ Mean-
