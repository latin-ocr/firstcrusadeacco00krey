208 THE FIRST CRUSADE

the battle. And thus, since the battle, once begun, was lasting
long and severely, the Duke's knights, who equalled the number
of the twelve apostles and regarded their lord as the vicar of God,
encouraged one another and fearlessly attacked the lines of the
Turks. There God granted so great a victory to the Duke that
he killed almost thirty οἱ the enemy and took the same number
captive; and, pursuing the rest in the swamps and the river which
were nearby, he forced some to be destroyed, some drowned. And
so he came to Antioch with a great victory, for he caused several
heads of the dead to be carried by the living Turks, a sight joyful
enough for us.

And so, when all the princes had come together into the church
of St. Peter, they began to talk about our journey. Then some who
held castles and revenues in the region of Antioch said: “What
will be done about Antioch? Who will keep it? The Emperor will
not come. For when he received the message that the Turks were
besieging us, he fied, trusting neither his own courage nor the multi-

to the Emperor upon the Cross of the Lord, and the Crown of
thorns, and upon many other holy objects‚ that we would not retain
without his will any city or fortress of all that belonged to his
Empire.’'

And thus, with some contradicting the others in this way and that,
the princes suffered such discord that they almost came to blows.
The Duke and the Count of Flanders regarded the city of Antioch
light1y3 for though they wished Bohemund to have it, yet they dared
not approve giving it to him for sear of incurring the infamy of
perjury.1³ In this way, accordingly, the matter of the journey and
other things pertaining to the journey and to the poor were put off.
However, when the people saw this, each one began to say to his
companion and neighbor, then openly to all: “Since the princes,
either from sear or because of their oaths to the Emperor, are un-
willing to lead us to Jerusalem, let us choose some brave knight in
serving whom loyally we can be safe, and, if it is the will of God,
we will arrive in Jerusalem with this same knight as leader. Alas!
is it not enough for the princes that we have been here a year, and
two hundred thousand armed men have been wasted? Let them
