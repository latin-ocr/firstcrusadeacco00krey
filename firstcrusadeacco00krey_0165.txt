THE FIRST CRUSADE 143

the Church to the Church of the &Vesss fellowship in celestial
Jerusalem, and a portion of the reward of their labor.

Since we are not unaware than you delight in the increase of tlie
Church, and we believe that you are concerned to hear matters ad-
verse as well as prosperous, we hereby notify you of the success
of our undertaking. Therefore, be it known to your delight that
God has triumphed in forty important cities and in two hundred
fortresses of His Church in Romania, as well as in Syria, and that
we still have one hundred thousand men in armor, besides the
common throng, though many were lost in the first battles. But
what is this? What is one man in a thousand? NVhere we have a
count, the enemy have forty kings; where we have 3 company,
the enemy have a legion; where we have a knight, they have a duke;
where We have a foot—soldier, they have a count; where we have
a camp, they have a kingdom. However, confiding not in numbers,
nor in bravery, nor in any presumption, but protected by justice
and the shield of Christ, and with St. George, Theodore, Demetrius,
and Basil,²4 soldiers of Christ, truly supporting us, we have pierced,
and in security are piercing, the ranks of the enemy. On five
general battle-fields, God conquering, we have conquered.

to fight in the army of the Lord at the same place in which the Lord
fought, in which Christ suffered for us, leaving to you an example
that you should follow his foot-steps. Did not God‚ innocent, die
for us? Let us therefore also die, if it be our lot, not for Him,
but for ourselves, that by dying on earth we may live for God‚ Yet
it is (now) not necessary that we should die, nor fight much, for
we have (already) sustained the more serious trials, but the task
of holding the fortresses and cities has been heavily reducing our
army. Come, therefore, hasten to be repaid with the twofold re-
ward—namely, the land of the living and the land flowing with milk
and honey and abounding in all good things. Behold, men, by the
shedding of our blood the way is open everywhere. Bring nothing
with you except only what may be of use to us. Let only the men
come; let the women, as yet, be left. From the home in which there
are two, let one, the one more ready for battle, come. But those,
especially, who have made the vow, (let them come). Unless they
come and discharge their vow, I, apostolic Patriarch, the bishops,
