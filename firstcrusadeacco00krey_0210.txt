188 THE FIRST CRUSADE

And then corbam said “Can none of them be driven back at all ?''

And Mirdalin replied, “They will not yield a footstep, even if
all the people ot' the pagans attack them.”

Then‚ although disturbed in mind, he drew up his many and
multiple lines against us. And when at first they could have pre-
vented our exit, they allowed us to go out in peace. Our men, how-
ever, now directed their lines toward the mountains‚ {earing that
the Turks might surround them from the rear. However, the
mountains were about two long miles from the bridge. We were
advancing in open file as the clergy are wont to march in processions.
And verily we had a processioni For the priests and many monks,
dressed in white robe5‚ went in front of the lines of our knights,
chanting and invoking the aid of the Lord and the benediction οἱ
the saints. The enemy, on the contrary, rushed against us and shot
arrows C orbam, now ready to do what he had just recently re-
fused, likewise sent word to our princes (proposing) that five or ten
Turks should do battle with a like number of Franks, and that
those whose knights were conquered should peacefully yield to
the others. To this our leaders replied, “You were unwilling when
we wanted to do this; now that we have advanced to fight, let each
fight for his right.”

And when we had occupied the whole plain, as we said, a certain
portion of the Turks remained behind us and attacked some of
our foot-soldiers. But those foot-soldiers, turning about, sustained
the attack of the enemy vigorously. When, indeed, the Turks could
in no way drive them out, they set fire around them, so that those
who did not sear the swords might at all events be terrified by fire.
And thus they forced them to give way, for that place had much
dry hay.

And when the lines had gone forth, the priests, with bare feet and
garbed in their priestly vestments, stood on the walls of the city,
calling upon God to defend His people, and through the victory of
the Franks in this battle to afford a testimony hallowed by His
blood. Moreover, as we were advancing from the bridge up to
the mountain, we met with great difficulty because the enemy wanted
to surround us. In the midst of this, the lines of the enemy fell
upon us who were in the squadron of the Bishop, and though their
forces were greater than ours, yet, through the protection of the
Holy Lance which was there, they there wounded no one; neither
did they hit any of us with arrows. I beheld these things of which
Ι speak ‘and Ι bore the Lance of the Lord there. If anyone says
that Viscount Heraclius, the standard—bearer of the Bishop, was
wounded in this battle, let him know that he handed over this
standard to another and fell behind our line some distance.
