THE FIRST CRUSADE 43

the churches of God in the regions of the Orient. More than this,
blasphemous to say, it has even grasped in intolerable servitude its
churches and the Holy City of Christ, glorified by His passion and
resurrection. Grieving with pious concern at this calamityâ€š we
visited the regions of Gaul and devoted ourselves largely to urging
the princes of the land and their subjeets to free the churches of
the East. We solemnly enjoined upon them at the council of
Auvergness (the accomplishment of) such an undertaking, as a prep-
aration for the remission of all their sins. And we have consti-
tuted our most beloved son, Adhemar, Bishop of Puy, leader of this
expedition and undertaking in our stead, so that those who, per-
chance, may wish to undertake this journey should comply with
his commands, as if they were our own, and submit fully to his
loosings or bindings, as far as shall seem to belong to such an
office. If, moreover, there are any of your people whom God has
inspired to this vow, let them know that he (Adhemar) will set out
with the aid of God on the day of the Assumption of the Blessed
Mary,42 and that they can then attach themselves to his following.
