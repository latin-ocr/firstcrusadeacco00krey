186 THE FIRST CRUSADE

If he cannot do this, let him say the Paternoster five times. When
this has been done, begin battle in the name 01 1116 Lord by day or
by night, as the judgment 01 1116 princes deems best, because the
hand 01 God will be with you. If anyone has doubt 01 victory,
let the gates be opened 101 him, and let him go forth to the Turks‚
and he will see how their God will save him. Moreover, if any-
0116 shall 1611156 10 fight, let him be classed with Judas, the betrayer
01 1116 Lord, who deserted the apostles and sold his Lord to the
Jews. Let them fight in the 131111 01 St. Peter, holding in rnind that
God promised him that 31161 1116 third day He would arise and
appear to him, and 101 11115 1635011, 3150, because this land is justly
St. Peter's, and not the pagans'. And let your battle-cry be ‘God
help us !’ and verily God will help you. All your brothers who died
since the beginning 01 1116 expedition are present with you in this
fight ; you have only to 5101111 1116 tenth part 01 1116 enemy, because
they will assai] nine parts in the might and command 01 God. And
do not put off the battle, because (11 you do), the Lord will lead
as many enemies from the other sides as you have on this side, and
He will keep you shut up here until you devour one another. But
know certainly that those days are at hand which the Lord promised
to the Blessed Mary and to His apostles, saying that He would
13156 up the kingdom of the Christians‚ after the kingdom 01 1116
pagans had been cast down and ground into dust. But do not turn
to their tents in search 01 gold and silver.’'

Then the power 01 God was disclosed, in that He who had com-
manded the above words to be preached to us through His apostle so
comforted the hearts 01 311, 11131 each one in saith and hope seemed
to himself already to have triumphed over his enemy. They urged
on one another, and in urging regained courage for fighting. The
crowd, t00‚ which in the past days seemed to be consumed with
want and ssight, now reproached the princes and complained 01 1116
delay 01 1116 battle. However, when the day 101· battle had been
fixed, our princes sent word by Peter the Hermit to C orbam, leader
of the Turks, to give up the siege of the city, because it was by
right the property 01 St. Peter and the C'hristians. That proud
leader replied that, rightly or wrongly, he was going to rule over
the Franks and the city. And he compelled Peter the Hermit, who
was unwilling to bow, to kneel to him.

The question was raised at this time as to who should guard the
city against those who were in the citadel, while the rest went forth
to fight. They built a stone wall and ramparts on our hill against
the enemy; these they fortified with many rocks, finally leaving
Count Raymond‚ who was deathly ill, and about two hundred men

there.
