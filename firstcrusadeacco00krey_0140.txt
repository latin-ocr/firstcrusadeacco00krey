120 THE FIRST CRUSADE

these. were gifts of the mercy of God. Truly, one would not know
whether to laugh or to cry from pity, when many of our men
without pack-mules, since many of theirs had already perished,
loaded sheep, goats, hogs, and dogs with their supplies, such as
clothing, and food, and whatever luggage was necessary for pil-
grims. The skin of those animals was worn by the weight of the
baggage. And knights with their armor sometimes even mounted
oxen. But who ever heard such a mixture of languages in one
army? There were Franks, Flemish, Frisians‚ Gauls, Allobroges,
Lotharingians, Alemanni, Bavarians, Normans, Angles, ScotS,
Aquitanians, Italians, Dacians, Apuliam, Iberiam, Bretons‚ Greeks
and Armenians.⁶ If a Breton or Teuton questioned me, Ι would

(Gesta.) There Tancred, son of Marchisus, and Baldwin‚ the
famous Count, brother of Duke Godfoey, separated from the others,
and together went into the valley of Botrenthrot.⁷ Tancred went
to Tarsus alone with his troops. At length, the Turks carne out
f1 om the city and advanced to meet them; then, gathered together,
they hastened to battle against the Christians. As our rnen ap-
proached and fought, our enemy fled, returning rapidly to the city.

But Tancred, distinguished and honorable knight of Christ,
loosened his breast-plate and encamped before the gate of the city.
From another side, thereupon, came the famous man, Count Bald-
win,- with his army, demanding and praying Tancred, most harsh
knight, that with the greatest friendship he would deign to take
him most kindly into partnership in the city. To him Tancred said,
“I absolutely refuse to take you into partnership.” And so when
night came, the terrified Turks took to flight in a body. Then the
inhabitants of the city came out under the shadows of the night,
