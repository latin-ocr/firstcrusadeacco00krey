212 THE FIRST CRUSADE

tortured to death the Saracens whom they could find. It happened,
however, to some of our men that when they led the Saracens
through the city for spoils, the Saracens conducted thern to cisterns,
and suddenly hurled themselves into them, choosing death rather
than to be willing to reveal their own or other's property. Where-
fore, all fell down dead: and they were cast forth among the swamps
of the city and outside the walls. And so not much booty⁰ was
taken in the city.

Meanwhile, a quarrel arose between Bohemund’s men' and those
of the Count for the reason that, though the ¹knights of Bohemund
had not taken much part in the siege, they obtained the largest
number of towers, houses, and captives. The Lord performed a
miracle in the capture of Marra. Before it was taken, although
we expounded to the people the commands of the apostles Peter
and Andrew, just as was written above, Bohemund and his corn-
panions laughed at us. Therefore, neither he nor those with him
were present at the fight, but rather were absent. And since they
now had the greatest share ot‘ the spoils, some of the Count’s fol-
lowing bore it unworthily. At length, a disagreement arose be-
tween the leaders themselves, because the Count wished to give the
city to the Bishop of Barra, and Bohemund was unwilling to let
go the towers which had surrendered to him, saying, “Unless the
Count gives up to me the towers at Antioch, Ι will not agree with
him in anything.'' ’

Meanwhile, the knights and people began to ask about the Journey,
when it would plcase the princes to begin it. For though the march
had ‘started long time ago, yet it seemed to us merely to begin the
journey, since it was not yet ended. Bohemund said that he would
put it off to Easter, and it was then the Christmas time. Many,
likewise, despaired because there were few horses in the army, and
the Duke was absent, and many of the knights went away to Bald-
win of Edessa. Therefore many turned back. At length the Bishop
of Albara and some nobles met with the poor people and summoned
the Count. When the Bishop had finished his preaching, the knights
and all the people knelt before the Count. With many tears they
prayed him to whom the Lord had given the Lance to become their
leader and lord of: this same army, adding that he had especially
merited the Lance of the'Lord for the reason that if the other
princes failed, he himself, indebted for so great a blessing of the
Lord, would not sear to go forward in security with the people.
Otherwise, he should give the Lance to the people, and the people
would go to Jerusalem with the Lord Himself as leader. However,
the Count hesitated because of the absence of the other princes
