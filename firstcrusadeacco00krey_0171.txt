THE FIRST CRUSADE 14‘)

turned to camp with great rejoicing, many horses‚ and much booty.
A certain memorable incident occurred there, which would that
those who follow our vows could had seen! lor while a certain
horseman of the enemy through sear of death was rushing headlong
into the depths of the stream, he was caught by many of his own
people and cast down from his horse and brushed off in the middle
of the stream, together with that multitude which had caught him.
It was worth the trouble to have seen some of the poor returning
from the victory, for some of them, riding about among the tents on
Arabian homes, displayed to their companions the relies of their
poverty; others, moreover‚ dressed in two or three silken garments,
magnified God, the Giver of victory and reward; still others, pro-
tected by three or four shields, eagerly showed the evidence of
their triumph. And while by these and other displays they per-
suaded us to a belief in the magnificent victory, they could not
persuade us of the number killed. Since the victory had been.
obtained at evening, the heads of the dead were not carried to
camp. And the next day, when the fortress was to be erected
before the enemy’s bridge, some of the Turks were found in the
ditch, for that hill was used as a burial ground of the Saracens.
Thereupon, the poor, provoked at the remains of these people‚
broke open all their tombs. And thus when the Turks had been
exhumed, no one had a doubt how great had been the victory, for
about fifteen hundred were counted. I am not speaking now about
those buried in the city and those carried off by the river. How-
ever, when the unbearable stench oppressed those who were at work
on the fortress, the corpses were cast forth into the river. The
sailors, indeed, who had been scattered and wounded in the flight
of the Count and Bohemund‚ were still dubious, because of their
fright, about the extent of the victory. However, when they saw
so great a multitude of dead, as though made well thereby, they
began to magnify God, who is wont to correct and gladden His
children. Therefore it had been so arranged by the disposition of
God that those who had given to the wild beasts and birds the
bearers of provisions destroyed on the coast and on the banks of
the river should themselves become food for the beasts and the
birds in the same places. Accordingly, when the victory had been
recognized and celebrated and the fortress constructed, the city of
Antioch was besieged from north and south.

, Consultation was held at this time as to who of the princes could
go to garrison the fortress. Verily, a matter of common respon-
sibility is frequently neglected, since each one thinks that it is being
looked after by others. And while some of the princes, as if for
