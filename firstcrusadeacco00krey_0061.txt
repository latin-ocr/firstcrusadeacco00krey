⁵ THE FIRST CRUsADE 45

what happened to these pilgrims on the way, how, little by
little, by the grace of God, their undertaking and their labor
gloriously succeeded. I, Fulcher of ChartreS, went with the other
pilgrims, and for the benefit of posterity I have carefully and
diligently stored all this in my memory, just as I witnessed it.

In the year 1096, and in the month of March following the coun-
cil, which, as has been said, Pope Urban held during November in
Auvergne, some who were more prompt in their preparation than
others began to set out on the holy journey. Others followed in
April, or May, in June, or in July, or even in August, or Septem-
ber, or October, as they were able to secure the means to defray
their expenses. That year peace and good crops of grain and grapes
flourished everywhere, by the disposition of God, lest those who
chose to follow Him with their crosses, in accordance with His
precept, should fail on the way for want of food. . . .

What further shall I say? The islands of the sea and all the
regions of the earth were shaken under foot, 50 11131 it would seem
that the prophecy of David was fulfilled, who said in the psalm, “All
the nations thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O
Lord’‘2; and that, also, which those who came later justly said, “We
will worship in the place where His feet have stood.'’ Of this
joui-ney, moreover, we have rea-<l much more in the Prophets, which
it would be tedious to repeat, Oh what grief, what sighs, what
weeping! What lamentations among friends, when the husband left
his wife so deas to him, and his children, and all his possessions,
his father, his mother, his brothers, or his relatives! But in spite
of such tears which those who remained shed for departing friends
in their very presence, the crusaders were still in no wise weakened
by this; and for love of God they left all that they possessed, firmly
convinced that they would receive that hundred-fold which the
Lord has promised to those who love Him. Then husband advised
wife of the time of his return, assuring her that if he lived, by
God’s grace, he would return to her. He corrnnended her to the
Lord, he kissed her tenderly, and, weeping, he promised to return.
But she, fearing that she would never see him more, was unable to
stand and fell senseless to the ground and wept for her love, whom,
though living, she had lost as though already dead. He, like one
who had no pity--though he had—and as if moved neither by the
tears of his wife nor the grief of any friends—and still in his 116311
116 was moved—set out, keeping his purpose firm. Sadness was
the lot of those who remained, those who left were gladi What
then can we add further? “This is the Lord’s domgs and it is
marvelous in our eyes.”³
