THE FIRST CRUSADE 24¹

vantage to those seeking Jerusalem, and was yet to be of great
advantage, was saved from death.

Thus their anger had its beginning; thus began the kindling of
the1r hate. . . . While their arms were idle and ease shut out war-
like cares, the question of the finding of the above mentioned spear
point was to be put to test, for division was disturbing the people.
These favored the Lance, those condemned it, neither party at all
reasonable. As a result, the chief leaders agreed that he who had
been the beginning of the difficulty should himself end it, and should
prove the matter in question by the ordeal of fire. Accordingly,
when Peter had been brought in to the council, they decided that he
should take nine steps hither and thither through the midst of burn-
ing, flaming branches, that by this test the finding would be proved
true, if he were unhurt, or false, if he were burnt. A period
of three days was set aside for a fast, and proper provision was
made for prayer and virgil. So they separated. But soon, on the
third day, they met again. Branches were set afire in a double row.
Peter, dressed in a shirt and breeches, otherwise naked‚ proceeded
through the midst of it, fell burned at the other end, and died on
the following day. The people, upon seeing what was done, con-
fessed that they had been deceived by his wordy guile, were sorry
that they had erred, and testified that Peter was a disciple of Simon,
the magician.22

But Raymond and his Provencal accomplices defended the accused
with obstinate minds,‘·'3 proclaimed him a saint, threatened Arnulf,
as the chief discoverer of the fraud which had been revealed and,
finally, sent an armed band against him to overwhelm him unex-
pectedly at his house. Had he not previously warned the Count
of Normandy, in whose service he was, he would have come to an
early death. The Count was eating, with him the Count of F landers,
and both were reclining. WVhen they heard the cause of the com-
motion, their session was broken off. The Counts separated, each
to his own forces, and both sent arms to oppose the armed men.
But frightened by the commotion of the Normans which they heard,
they tried to cover up the matter, making believe that they were
looking for something else and had some other intent. By this
artifice they saved themselves ; otherwise those whom flight spared
would have grieved, not that they had taken up arms in vain, but

that they had done so unfortunately.
