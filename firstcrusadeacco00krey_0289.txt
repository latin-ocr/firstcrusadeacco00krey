THE FIRST CRUSADE 265

our redemption and glory, delights with inconceivable joy, because
through the effort and incomparable might 01 1116 50115 of God it
has been liberated from most 611161 pagan servitude. And let us
also be joyful, whose Christian 131111 111 such times as these has been
placed in 3 11111101 01 eternal clarity.

We, therefore, admonished, summoned, and compelled, 001 only
through the letters 01 Lord Pope Paschal, but, also, through the
most humble prayers 01 Duke Godfrey, whom the army 01 Christ
by divine direction elevated as King, as well as through the mela
lifluous entreaties 01 Lord Arnult', whom they have unanimously
chosen as Patriarch 01 1116 566 01 Jerusalem—we command with
equal affection that you have every one 01 your parish churches,
without fail, pray with 13515 and almsgiving that the King of Kings
and the Lord 01 Lords crown the King 01 1116 Christians with victory
against the enemy, and the Patriarch with religion and wisdom
against the sects and deceptions 01 heretics. We command, like-
wise, and admonish, through your obedience, that you constrain by
threat all who vowed to go on the expedition and took the sign of
the 61055 upon themselves to set out for Jerusalem, if they are
vigorous 01 body and *have the ‘means to accomplish the journey.
As 101 1116 0111615, however, do not 66356 skilfully and most de-
voutly to admonish them not to neglect aiding the people 01 God,
50 11131 not only the first, but likewise the last, may receive the
shilling which is promised to 111056 laboring in the vineyard.¹⁸
Farewell.

Pray 101 the Bishop 01 Puy, for the Bishop 01 Orange, 101·
Αο56110 01 Ribemont, and 101 311 1116 0111615 who lie at rest, crowned
with so glorious a martyrdom.

5. Battle of Ascalon. (August 7—August 15, 1099.)

(Gesta.) Meanwhile, a messenger came to Tancred and Count
Eustace, bidding them make themselves ready to go to take the city
01 Neapolis. They went forth, taking along many knights and foot—
- so'ldiers and came to the city, but its inhabitants surrendered there.
A short while after this, the Duke sent word to them to come quickly
to battle, because the Emir 01 Babylon was ready at the city 01
Ascalon. Then they entered the mountainous region in haste,
seeking fight with the Saracens, and came to Caesarea. And then,
when they had come near the sea to the city of Ramlah‚ they found
there many Arabs who were the 101611100615 of the battle. Our
men pursued these and captured several 01 them, who told all the
news 01 1116 battle, where and how manv the enemy were, and
where they were planning to fight the Christians.
