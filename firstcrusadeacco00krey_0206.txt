184 THE FIRST CRUSADE

who had everything in charge, that if he saw a light burn at the
head of the army he should have the trumpets sounded for it
to retreat, knowing that the Turks had lost the battle. Curbara
began immediately to retreat little by little toward the mountain,
and our men followed thern little by little. At length the Turks
divided; one party went toward the sea and the rest halted there,
expecting to enclose our men between them. As our men saw this,
they did likewise. There a seventh line was formed from the lines
of Duke Godfrey and the Count of Normandy‚ and its head was
Reinald. They sent this (line) to meet the Turks, who were coming
from the sea. The Turks, however, engaged them in battle and by
shooting killed many of our men. Other squadrons, moreover,
were drawn out from the river to the mountain, which was about
two miles distant. The squadrons began to go forth from both
sides and to surround our men on all sides, hurling, shooting‚ and
wounding them. There came ont from the mountains, also, count-
less armies with white horses, whose standards were all white.
And so, when our leaders saw this army, they were entirely ignorant
as to what it was, and who they were, until they recognized the aid
of Christ, whose leaders were St. George‚ Mercurius, and Demetrius.⁹
This is to be believed, for many of our men saw it. However, when
the Turks who were stationed on the side toward the sea saw that
that they could hold out no longer, they set fire to the grass, so that,
upon seeing it, those who were in the tents might fiee. The latter,
recognizing that signal, seized all the precious spoils and fled. But
our men fought yet a little while where their (the Turks) greatest
strength was, that is, in the region of their tents. Duke Godstey,
the Count of Flanders, and Hugh the Great rode near the water,
where the enemy's strength lay. These men, fortified by the sign
of the cross, together attacked the enemy first. When the other
lines saw this, they likewise attacked. The Turks and the Persians
in their turn cried out. Thereupon, we invoked the Living and True
God and charged against them, and in the name of Jesus Christ
and of the Holy Sepulchre we began the battle, and, God helping,
we overcame them. But the terrified Turks took to fiight, and our
men followed them to the tents. Thereupon‚ the knights of Christ
chose rather to pursue them than to seek any spoils, and they pursued
them even to the Iron Bridge, and then up to the fortress of Tan-
cred. The enemy, indeed, left their pavilions there, gold, silver,
and many ornaments, also sheep, cattle, horses, mules, camels, asses,
grain, wine, butter, and many other things which we needed. When

· the Armenians and Syrians who dwelt in those regions heard that

we had overcome the Turks, they ran to the mountain to meet thern
