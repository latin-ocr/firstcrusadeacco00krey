CHAPTER I

THE SUMMONs

(After Fulcher’s preface, which seems admirably suited to this account,
the chapter deals with the call for ·Crusaders from the west. The condition
of Europe on the eve of the Crusade is too large a subject to be treated
adequately here, but Fulcher's brief summary contains a very suggestive
survey of the situation and is interestingly supplemented by Ekkehard's
contrast of conditions in East and &Vest Frankland. Most of the causes
of the movement may be inferred from Urban's speech at Clermont.

The Council of Clermont was held in November 1095 and lasted for ten
days, from the eighteenth to the twenty-eighth of the month, the famous
address of Urban being delivered on the day before the close of the Council.
The four writers who were vpresumably present wrote their versions of the
speech several years after it occurred, that of Fulcher being perhaps the
earliest. Each may have preserved notes taken at the time, but it is ex-
tremely interesting to observe that each stresses that phase of the speech
which especially appealed to him. Robert the Monk seems to have responded
as a patriotic Frenchman, Balderic as a member of the *Church hierarchy‚
Guibert as a mystic, Fulcher, here, as always, as the simple cure—all as
churchmen.4 Enough has been added by the writers to indicate that most
of Urban’s audience, which consisted principally of the clergy‚ became un-
official preachers of the Crusade when they returned to their own districts.
This is indicated also by Urban's letter to the Crusaders in Flanders‚ written
less than a month after the Council, which was half plea and half instruc-
tion to men already aroused. Urban himself spoke at other places in France
before returning to Italy to stir up the people there, but he did not go to
Germany for the reasons mentioned by both Fulcher and Ekkehard. The
appeal there, though indirect‚ was powerful, as the second chapter proves.
The call to the Crusade was sounded and resounded by Urban. even to the
time of his death, and by hundreds of others both during his life-time and

long thereafter.)

1. Conditions in Europe at the beyimziny of the Crusades.

(Fulcher.) In the year of our Lord 1095, in the reign of the so-
called Emperor⁵ Henry in Germany and of King Philip in France,
throughout Europe evils of all kinds waxed strong because of vacil-
lating faith. Pope Urban II ⁶ then ruled in the city of Rome. He
was ‘a man admirable in life and habits, who always strove wisely
and energetically to raise the status of Holy Church higher and
