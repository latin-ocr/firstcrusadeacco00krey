216 THE FIRST CRUSADE

This was near a certain fortified place in which there was gath-
ered a very large multitude of pagans. Our men attacked this
place and would have conquered it bravely, had not the Saracens
driven out immense herds of animals. Our men returned, carrying
goods of all kinds to their tents. At the break of dawn, however,
we folded our tents and went to besiege their fortified place. We
expected to pitch our camp there, but the pagan host took to flight
and left the place empty. However, when our men entered they
found there every abundance of wine, buttes, oil, and everything
that they needed. There we very devoutly celebrated the festival
of the Purification of the Virgin Mary. Envoys came to us there
from the city of Cam-ela.. For the King of that place sent horses
and gold to the Count and made an agreement with him that he
would not hurt Christians in any way, but would cherish and honor
them. Moreover‚ the King of Tripoli sent word to the Count that
he would faithfully enter into an agreement with him and keep
friendship, if it pleased him, and he sent him ten horses, four mules,
and gold. But the Count said that he would in no wise accept
peace with him, unless he became a Christian.

After leaving this very fine valley , we came to a certain
fortified town called Archas on Monday noon, the second day of
the week in the middle of February, and around it we pitched our
tentS. This town was filled with a countless host of pagans, Turks,
Saracens, Arabs, and ch-blicani, who had fortified the town marvel-
ously and were defending themselves bravely. At that time four-
teen of our knights went against the city of Tripoli, which was near
us. Those fourteen found about sixty Turks and certain others,
who had collected in front of them some men and more than five
hundred animals. Strengthened with the sign of the cross, they at-
tacked the Turks and, with the help of God, wonderfully overcame
them, killed six of them, and captured six horses. Furthermore,
Raymond Piletus and Raymond, Viscount of Turenne, went out
from the army of Count Raymond, and, coming before the city of
Tortosa‚ they strongly attacked it, fortified, as it was, by a very
great multitude of pagans. But since night had already come, they
withdrew to a certain retired place and camped there3 then they
built countless fires, as if the whole host was there. Indeed, the
pagam, terrified with fear, fled secretly by night and left the city
filled with goods of all kinds. It also contained a very fine port
on the sea. On the next day our men went to attack it on all sides
and found it empty. They entered and lived in it as long as the
siege before Archas lasted. There is near it another city called
Maraclea. The Emir who ruled over it made an agreement with
our men and let our men and our standards into the city.
