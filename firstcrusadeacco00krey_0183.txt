(People of Luem). To the primates, archbishops, bishops‚ and
other rectors, and to all the faithful of the lands of Christ any-
where; the clergy and people of Lucc'a (send) greeting full of peace
and gladness in the Lord.

To the praise and glory of the Redeemer, our Lord Jesus Christ,
we are truly and faithfully making known to all (the news) which
we received truly and faithfully from participants in the affairs
themselves—at what time, with what great triumph, the most
mighty right hand of Christ gave complete victory over the pagans
to our brethren, His champions, after trial and perils. A certain
citizen of ours, Bruno by name, known and very dear to all of uS‚

that is the first Friday, our princes decided to erect a fortress at
the western gate of the city. This fortress, a very short ballista-
shot away (from the city), is now called by the name of the Blessed
Mary. There, on that same day, in an attack of the Turks, in
which they killed 2,o55 of our men, we killed 800 of the enemy.
From the third day, morever, when the fortress had been erected‚
until the third day before the Nones of June, our men endured many
hardships‚ and, weakened by hunger and the sword, they toiled
there at great eost. However, on this day the city was captured in
the following manner: Four brothers, noble men of Antioch, on
the second day of June promise to surrender the city to Bohemund,
