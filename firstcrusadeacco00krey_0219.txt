THE FIRST CRUSADE 197

their sins the Syrians and the poor people, seized with great fear,
began immediately to take the way back again. As the Turks saw
them coming back, they began at once to pursue them, and victory
ministered strength to them3 thus many of these people gave up
their souls to God for love of whom they had there assembled. This
slaughter occurred on the fifth day in the month of July. However,
the Franks who had remained returned to their camp, and there
Raymond lingered with his people for several days. But the others
who had remained in Antioch stayed in the city with great joy and
gladness.

Their guide and shepherd was the Bishop of Puy, who at the
nod of God was taken with a serious illness and, as it was the will
of God, departed from this earth and, resting in peace, slept in the
Lord on the festival of St. Peter which is called Ad Vincula.³ As
a result, there was great anguish, tribulation‚ and very great grief
in the whole Christian army, because he had been a support to the
poor, counsel to the rich, and he had ordained clergy. He had
preached and admonished the leaders saying: “No one of you can
be saved, unless he respects and refreshes the poor. You cannot be
saved without them, they cannot live without you; it is fitting,
therefore, that they pray God in daily supplication for your sins,
because you offend Him daily in many ways. Therefore, I ask you
for the love of God to cherish them and sustain thern as much as

you can.'’

Not long after this, the venerable man, Raymond, Count of St. ν’

Gilles, went out, and, entering the land of the Saracens, ,he came to
‘a 'certain city called Barra‚ which he attacked with his army and
straightway captured. He killed all the Saracen men and women,
noble and common, whom he found there. After he held it in his
power, he recalled it to the faith of Christ. He then sought coun-
sel from his wisest men, that he might have a bishop most devoutly
ordained in this city, to recall it loyally to the worship of Christ
and out of the house of the devil to consecrate a temple and altars
of the saints to the true and living God. They straightway chose
a certain honorable and very wise man and conducted him to Anti-
och to be consecrated, and this was done. The rest, however, who
had remained in Antioch were there with great joy and gladness.

Bohemund, the Count, the Duke, and the Count of Flanders, re-
ceived the fortress of the city; but Bohemund took the highest
towers, already at that time plotting the wiles by which he caused
an injustice. For he next drove the men of the Duke, of the
Count of Flanders, and of the Count of St. Gilles violently from
