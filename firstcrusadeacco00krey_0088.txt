72 THE FIRST CRUSADE

and d1·ank; and others dug up the moist ground and lay down on
their backs and spread the earth over their breasts to relieve the
excessive dryness of thirst. The bishops and priests, indeed, con-
tinued to comfort our people, and to admonish them not to yield,
saying, “Be everywhere strong in the faith of Christ, and do not
fear those who persecute you, just as the Lord saith, ‘Be not afraid
of them that kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul.' ”⁷ This
distress lasted for eight days. Then the lord of the Alemanni made
an agreement with the Turks to surrender his companions to them;
and, feigning to go out to fight, he fied to thern, and many with
him. Those, however, who were unwilling to deny the Lord re-
ceived the sentence of death; some, whom they took alive, they
divided among themselves, like sheep; some they placed as a target
and shot with arrows; others they sold and gave away, like animals.
Some they took captive to their own home, some to Chorosan, some
to Antioch, others to Aleppo, or wherever they themselves lived.
These were the first to receive a happy martyrdom in the name of
the Lord Jesus.

Next‚ the Turks‚ hearing that Peter the Hermit and Walter the
Penniless were in Civitote, which is located above the city of Nicaea,
went there with great joy to kill them and those who were with
them. And when they had come, they encountered Walter with
his men, (all of) whom the Turks soon killed. But Peter thc-
Hermit had gone to Constantinople a short while before because he
was unable to restrain that varied host, which was not willing to
listen either to him or to his words. The Turks‚ indeed, rushed
upon these people and killed many of them. Some they found
sleeping‚ some lying down, others naked—all of whom they killed.
With these people they found a certain priest celebrating mass,
whom they straightway martyred upon the altar. Those who could
escape fied to Civitote; others hurled themselves headlong into the
sea, while some hid in the forests and mountains. But the Turks,
pursuing them to the fortress, collected wood to burn them with
the fort. The Christians who were in the fort, therefore, set fire
to the wood that had been collected, and the fire, turning in the di-
rection of the Turks, cremated some of them; but from the fire the
Lord delivered our people at that time. Nevertheless‚ the Turks
took them alive and divided them, just as they had done the others,
and scattered them through all these regions, some to Chorosan, and
others to Persia. This all happened in the month of October. The
Emperor, upon hearing that the Turks had so scattered our people,
was exceedingly glad and sent for them (the Turks) and had them
cross the Strait. After they were across, he purchased all their
armS. . . .
