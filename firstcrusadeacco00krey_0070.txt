54 THE FIRST CRUSADE

rounded partly by swamps and partly by woods. For rumor had
reached and forewarned the ears of King Coloman; a rumor that,
to the minds of the Teutons‚ there was no difference between kill-
ing pagans and Hungarians. And so, for six weeks they besieged
the fortress Wieselbury and suffered many hardships there; yet,
during this very time, they were in the throes of a most foolish
civil quarrel over which one of them should be King of Pannonia.
Moreover, while engaged in the final assault‚ although the walls
had already been broken through, and the citizens were fleeing, and
the army of the besieged were setting fire to their own town, yet,
through the wonderful providence of Alrnighty God, the army of
pilgrims, though victorious, fled. And they left behind them all
their equipment, for no one carried away any reward except his
wretched life. ,

And thus the men of our race, zealous, doubtless‚ for God, though
not according to the knowledge of G0d‚ began to persecute other
Christians while yet upon the expedition which Christ had pro-

Peter and Gottschalk, after collecting an army, had set out, there
assembled in like fashion a large and innumerable host of Chris-

of France, England‚ Flanders, and Lorraine. . .. . Iumknowhnot.
whether by a judgment of the Lord, or by some error of mind,
they rose in a spirit of cruelty against the Jewish people scattered
throughout these cities and slaughtered them without mercy, espe-
cially in the Kingdom of Lorraine, asserting it to be the beginning
of their expedition and their duty against the enemies of the Chris-
tian saith. This slaughter of Jews was done first by citizens of
Cologne. These suddenly fell upon a small band of Jews and
severely wounded and killed many; they destroyed the houses and
synagogues of the Jews and divided among themselves a very large
amount of money. When the Jews saw this cruelty, about two h n-
dred in the silence of the night began flight by boat-to Neuss. T e
pilgrims and crusaders discovered them, and after taking away all
their possessions‚ inflicted on them similar slaughter, leaving not
even one alive.

Not long after this, they started upon their Journey, as they had
